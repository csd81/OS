**11. Distributed File Management**

- Introduction  
- Referencing files  
- Performing operations  
  – Remote procedure call  
  – Operations in local temporary storage  
- Implementation of the service provider  
- File replication

---

 

---

**11.1 Introduction**

- Extension of the local operating system’s file management services to a group of computers connected through communication channels.
- A file can be local or remote; ideally, the actual location of the file is hidden from the user.
- The computer that stores the file is the **server**, and it provides services (operations) on the files to the **clients**.
- Distributed file management is slower (e.g., file discovery, file transfer).

---

 

---

**Performance Enhancement**

- **Special hardware components**
  - Fast communication channel  
  - High-speed storage at the provider side  
  - Specialized architecture of providers, large central memory  

- **Software techniques**
  - Fast (low-information) communication protocols  
  - Tuning the provider’s OS and scheduling algorithm to the task  
  - Temporary storage (caching) at the provider or client side  

---

 

---

**11.2 Referencing Files**

**Name**  
- The name uniquely identifies the file.  
- It hides the storage details from the user (which machine it's on, and where on that machine, etc.).

**File Names**  
- Two levels are distinguished:  
  – User-level names  
  – System-level names  

- The file management system’s task is to map the two levels of identifiers to each other.

---

 

---

**File Name Mapping**

- **Location transparency**  
  – The file name does not indicate which machine the file is located on.

- **Location independence**  
  – The file name does not change even if the file is moved to another machine.  
    File migration is initiated by the distributed system.

- In the first case, name mapping is done based on **static tables**.  
  In the second case, **dynamically changing mapping information** must be used  
  (less supported and significantly more complex).

---

 

---

**Advantages of Location-Independent Naming**

- The name hides all information related to physical storage (the file becomes a completely abstract concept).  
- With file migration, the distributed OS can manage the entire storage space uniformly and handle free space system-wide (dynamic load balancing).  
- The naming system is completely independent of the specific connection structure, meaning special files do not need to be stored on pre-designated nodes.

---

 

---

**Naming Methods**

- **Explicit naming of the node**
  - A file reference consists of two parts:
    - the name of the node and  
    - the name of the file in the local file system  
  - e.g., in VMS: `<node name>::<file name>`

- **Mapping the remote file system to a point in the local directory hierarchy (mount)**
  - The remote machine must also be named.  
  - After mounting, remote files can be accessed just like local files.  
  - Example: UNIX Network File System (NFS)  
  - Limitation: only the parts of the remote hierarchy that are explicitly shared are visible.  
    The access path to a given file may differ between machines.

- **Uniform naming that covers the entire distributed system**
  - Use of global (system-wide) names.

---

 

---

**Implementation of a Distributed File Naming System**

- The task of the naming system is to map user-level names to specific nodes and the physical locations within them.

- Use of mapping tables.

- Optimization is needed:  
  – Mapping based on file groups  
  – Duplication of mapping tables  
  – Two-level mapping tables

---

 

---

**Mapping Based on File Groups**

- The mapping table would be too large if it included every individual file.  
- Files are organized into **groups** (component units), and the mapping is performed collectively for these groups.  
- Example: Remote directory hierarchies in NFS (Network File System).

---

 

---

**Replication of Mapping Tables**

- Every node must have access to the table; centralization is risky.  
- Reasons for replication:  
  • Decentralized, fault-tolerant system  
  • Data security  
  • Fast access to tables  
- Only the necessary parts are temporarily stored (cached) at each node — **timely updates are important**.

---

 

---

**Two-Level Mapping Tables**

- **User-level name**  
  ⬇  
- **Location-independent low-level name**  
  ⬇  
- **Physical location of the node**

---

This model separates logical naming from physical storage details, allowing for flexible and scalable file access in distributed systems.

 

---

**11.3 Performing Operations**

- The user wants to perform file operations as if the file were managed locally (after the system has located the referenced file).
- **Ways of performing operations**:  
  – Through remote services  
  – Using local temporary storage (caching)

---

 

---

**Using Remote Services**

User operations appear as requests at the provider node.

**Remote Procedure Call (RPC):**
- Every operation corresponds to a remote procedure. The client specifies the parameters of the procedure; the provider's response is the return value of the procedure.
- On the provider side, every remote procedure has an associated **daemon** process whose job is to handle incoming requests from clients.
- The daemon listens on an assigned **port** for incoming requests, executes them, and sends the response back to the originator (identified from the request).
- Communication between the client and the daemon is **asymmetric** — the client must know the daemon’s port (and thus, identify the daemon).

---

 

---

### **The Process of Remote Procedure Calls**

#### **Client side:**
1. The **user calls the kernel**: sends an RPC message to invoke procedure **X**.
2. The **kernel sends a message** to the **matchmaker** asking: "What is the port number?"  
   ➝ `From: client | To: server | Port: matchmaker | Re: address for RPC X`
3. The **matchmaker on the server** receives the message and **finds the response**.
4. The **matchmaker replies to the client** with the **port P**.  
   ➝ `From: server | To: client | Port: kernel | Re: RPC X Port P`
5. The **kernel inserts the port P** into the user’s message.
6. The **kernel sends the actual RPC message**.  
   ➝ `From: client | To: server | Port: P | <content>`
7. The **daemon listening on port P** receives the message.
8. The **daemon processes the request** and sends back the result.  
   ➝ `From: RPC | Port: P | To: client | Port: kernel | <result>`
9. The **kernel receives the result** and **forwards it to the user**.

---

 

---

**Special Problems of Remote Procedure Calls**

- **Network communication is unreliable.**  
  – It’s important that each request is executed **exactly once**.  
  – Clients **number the requests** and attach **timestamps**.  
    The server ignores any request that has already been served with the same sequence number.

- On the **client side**, remote procedure calls must be mapped to the correct **ports**, where the corresponding **daemon** is waiting. The mapping can be:
  - **Static**:  
    Each operation is assigned a predefined port.
  - **Dynamic**:  
    For each operation, a **matchmaker** daemon (in a fixed port) provides the actual port number.

---

 

---

### **Operations in Local Temporary Storage**

- To **increase performance** and **reduce network traffic**, local machines temporarily store the necessary files and perform operations on those local copies.
- This principle is similar to **caching** used in virtual memory management:
  - If needed, space is made for new information.
  - Required data is fetched from the network into the local cache.
  - Operations are performed on the **local copy**.
  - If changes occur, the updated information is **written back**.

---

### **Problems:**
- Defining the unit of data transfer  
- Deciding **where** to store temporary data  
- **Updating** changes to the main storage  
- Ensuring **consistency** of the temporary storage

---

 

---

**Defining the Transmission Unit**

- The size of the **available temporary storage**  
- The **permitted block size** of the underlying network protocol, and the **permitted block size in RPC (Remote Procedure Calling)**

---

 

---

**Location of Temporary Storage**

- **In the main memory (RAM) of the local machine**  
  – Fast  
  – Usable even without permanent storage

- **In the local machine’s secondary storage (disk)**  
  – Reliable  
  – Can contain entire files

---

 

---

### **Applying Updates (Update)**

- **Modifications must be communicated to the provider:**
  - **Immediately**
    - Slow  
    - Safe
  - **Delayed write**
    - Fast  
    - Not safe

- **Write-back (synchronization) can occur:**
  - When space is needed in the cache  
  - Periodically  
  - When the file is closed

---

 

---

### **Consistency of the Temporary Storage**

A file may be used by multiple clients. After a modification, a client's cached copy may become outdated.

**Updates must occur:**

- **At the client’s request** (e.g., the client suspects inconsistency and requests verification)  
  – On every access  
  – When reopening the file  
  – Periodically

- **At the provider’s initiative**  
  – The provider keeps track of clients’ local caches (via special messages from clients)  
  – If a file change causes inconsistency, the provider **notifies** the clients

**Notification (Consistency Semantics):**
- Immediately (e.g., when the file is closed)  
- In cases of foreseeable issues, the client may be advised **not to use local caching**, and instead **use remote services**

---

 

---

### **Comparison of the Two Methods**

#### **Advantages of Temporary Storage (Caching):**
- Most operations can be performed locally → faster execution, reduced network load  
- Transferring large blocks is more efficient  
  - Network protocol adds less overhead per block  
  - Disk operations on the provider side become faster

#### **Advantages of Remote Services:**
- No consistency issues (since the provider manages the single authoritative copy)  
- The client's resources do not limit the execution (e.g., not enough space for local storage)  
- The interface of remote services matches that of the local file management services

---

 

---

### **11.4 Implementation of the Service Provider**

- **Stateful provider**  
- **Stateless provider**

---

 

---

### **Stateful Service Provider**

- The provider stores information about:
  - client requests,  
  - the process of serving those requests, and  
  - the current state.
- When files are opened, the provider creates a **connection descriptor**, and **tracks the operations** until the file is closed.

---

#### **Advantages:**
- **Higher performance**
  - Sequential accesses can be prepared in advance, improving read performance
- Better **monitoring and handling of consistency issues**

---

#### **Disadvantages:**
- If the **provider crashes**, it cannot serve client requests. Clients must also terminate, and **rebuild the lost state**, which requires a **complex protocol**.
- If a **client crashes unexpectedly**, the provider must detect and clean up the "orphaned" state information (**orphan detection**).

---

 

---

### **Stateless Service Provider**

- No information is stored about clients; each request can be handled independently.

---

#### **Advantage:**
- **Failure of file operations** doesn't cause problems  
  (if the client doesn’t receive a reply, it simply retries the request)

---

#### **Disadvantage:**
- **Slower performance**:  
  – More information must be transferred with each request  
  – For each request, the file must be located again

---

 
---

### **11.5 File Replication**

It is worth replicating files.

- Increases the system's **fault tolerance** (replicas placed in independent nodes)  
- **Faster access** (e.g., selecting the "nearest" file or the **least-loaded node**)

---

### **Problems:**
- File naming (in a way that is invisible to the user) must **bind to a specific replica**  
- **Replication must be managed automatically**, including replica placement and removal  
- All **necessary modifications must be applied to every replica** (to ensure **consistency**)

---

 
---

### **Case Study: NFS**

This diagram illustrates the architecture of the NFS system between a **Client** and a **Server**:

#### **Client Side:**
- **System call layer** – user calls like `open()`, `read()`, etc.  
- **Virtual file system layer** – handles abstraction and routes requests  
- Split into:  
  - **Local OS** – handles local files  
  - **NFS client** – sends requests for remote files  
- **Local disk** and **messages sent to server** (over network)

#### **Server Side:**
- **Message from client** received over the network  
- **NFS server** – receives, processes, and responds to client requests  
- Works with:
  - **Virtual file system layer**
  - **Local OS**
  - **Local disk**

---

### **NFS Remote Procedure Calls**

| Remote Procedure Call | Returns |
|-----------------------|---------|
| `NULL()` | Do nothing. |
| `LOOKUP(dirfh, name)` | File handle and file attributes |
| `CREATE(dirfh, name, attr)` | File handle and file attributes |
| `REMOVE(dirfh, name)` | Status |
| `GETATTR(fh)` | File attributes |
| `SETATTR(fh, attr)` | File attributes |
| `READ(fh, offset, count)` | File attributes and data |
| `WRITE(fh, offset, count, data)` | File attributes |
| `RENAME(dirfh, name, tofh, toname)` | Status |
| `LINK(dirfh, name, tofh, toname)` | Status |
| `SYMLINK(dirfh, name, string)` | Status |
| `READLINK(fh)` | String |
| `MKDIR(dirfh, name, attr)` | File handle and file attributes |
| `RMDIR(dirfh, name)` | Status |
| `READDIR(dirfh, offset, count)` | Directory entries |
| `STATFS(fh)` | File system information |

Below is an example of a simple C++ simulation of NFS-like behavior. In this simulation, we mimic basic file operations (lookup, create, read, write, delete) using function calls. In a real NFS, these operations would be performed via RPC over a network; here we simulate the communication between a client and server by directly calling server methods.

You can compile and run this code using any C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <thread>
#include <chrono>

// A simple structure to represent a file
struct File {
    std::string name;
    std::string content;
};

// NFSServer simulates the file server functionality
class NFSServer {
public:
    // Lookup: search for a file by name
    bool lookup(const std::string& name, File& fileOut) {
        auto it = files.find(name);
        if (it != files.end()) {
            fileOut = it->second;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    // Create a file with an optional initial content
    bool create(const std::string& name, const std::string& content = "") {
        if (files.find(name) == files.end()) {
            File f { name, content };
            files[name] = f;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    // Read a portion of the file (from offset, count characters)
    std::string read(const std::string& name, size_t offset, size_t count) {
        auto it = files.find(name);
        if (it != files.end()) {
            const std::string &content = it->second.content;
            if (offset < content.size()) {
                return content.substr(offset, count);
            }
        }
        return "";
    }
    
    // Write data at a specified offset in the file
    bool write(const std::string& name, size_t offset, const std::string& data) {
        auto it = files.find(name);
        if (it != files.end()) {
            std::string &content = it->second.content;
            // If offset is greater than current size, pad with spaces
            if (offset > content.size()) {
                content.resize(offset, ' ');
            }
            // Replace part of the content or append new data
            content.replace(offset, data.size(), data);
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    // Remove (delete) a file
    bool remove(const std::string& name) {
        return files.erase(name) > 0;
    }

private:
    std::unordered_map<std::string, File> files;
};

// NFSClient simulates a client that uses the NFSServer
class NFSClient {
public:
    // The client holds a reference to the server. In a real RPC, 
    // the client would send messages over the network.
    NFSClient(NFSServer &serverRef) : server(serverRef) {}

    void lookupFile(const std::string &name) {
        File f;
        if (server.lookup(name, f)) {
            std::cout << "[Client] File found: " << f.name 
                      << " | Content: \"" << f.content << "\"\n";
        } else {
            std::cout << "[Client] File \"" << name << "\" not found.\n";
        }
    }

    void createFile(const std::string &name, const std::string &content = "") {
        if (server.create(name, content)) {
            std::cout << "[Client] File \"" << name << "\" created.\n";
        } else {
            std::cout << "[Client] File \"" << name << "\" already exists.\n";
        }
    }

    void readFile(const std::string &name, size_t offset, size_t count) {
        std::string result = server.read(name, offset, count);
        std::cout << "[Client] Read from \"" << name << "\": \"" 
                  << result << "\"\n";
    }

    void writeFile(const std::string &name, size_t offset, const std::string &data) {
        if (server.write(name, offset, data)) {
            std::cout << "[Client] Wrote to \"" << name 
                      << "\": \"" << data << "\" at offset " << offset << "\n";
        } else {
            std::cout << "[Client] Write failed, file \"" << name << "\" not found.\n";
        }
    }

    void deleteFile(const std::string &name) {
        if (server.remove(name)) {
            std::cout << "[Client] File \"" << name << "\" deleted.\n";
        } else {
            std::cout << "[Client] File \"" << name << "\" does not exist.\n";
        }
    }
    
    // Simulate an RPC delay (to emulate network latency)
    void simulateDelay(int milliseconds) {
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(milliseconds));
    }

private:
    NFSServer &server;
};

int main() {
    // Create the NFS server
    NFSServer server;
    
    // Create an NFS client that communicates with the server
    NFSClient client(server);

    // Simulate a series of operations similar to NFS RPCs.
    client.createFile("test.txt", "Hello, World!");
    client.simulateDelay(100);
    
    client.lookupFile("test.txt");
    client.simulateDelay(50);
    
    client.readFile("test.txt", 0, 5);  // Expected output: "Hello"
    client.simulateDelay(50);
    
    client.writeFile("test.txt", 7, "NFS");
    client.simulateDelay(50);
    
    client.readFile("test.txt", 0, 20); // Expected output will reflect the updated content.
    client.simulateDelay(50);
    
    client.deleteFile("test.txt");
    client.simulateDelay(50);
    
    client.lookupFile("test.txt");
    
    return 0;
}
```

### How This Simulation Works

- **NFSServer Class:**  
  Manages a map of file names to file contents. Operations like create, lookup, read, write, and delete are implemented.

- **NFSClient Class:**  
  Simulates the client-side operations that contact the server. Each method calls the corresponding server method and prints results, while `simulateDelay()` emulates network latency.

- **main Function:**  
  Demonstrates a basic sequence of NFS-like operations.

This simple simulation shows the core ideas of NFS:
- **Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs):** Client operations are made by calling server functions.  
- **File Management:** Operations like lookup, create, read, write, and delete are provided.  
- **Emulated Network Delays:** Even though we’re using local function calls, artificial delays mimic network transmission.

Feel free to modify or extend the simulation (for instance, adding error handling, more file attributes, or multithreading) to suit your needs or explore more NFS-like behavior!

### 🧩 **Detailed Key Differences**

#### 📁 **NFS (Network File System)**
- Designed for Unix/Linux, but also used on Windows.
- **NFSv2/v3** are **stateless**, relying on external protocols for locking and authentication.
- **NFSv4** is **stateful** with built-in support for security (Kerberos), ACLs, locking, and compound procedures.
- Simple and fast but can suffer from consistency issues without extra mechanisms.

#### 🪟 **SMB / CIFS (used in Windows networks)**
- Developed by **Microsoft**, tightly integrated with **Active Directory** and **NTFS ACLs**.
- **Stateful protocol** with detailed locking mechanisms (byte-range locks).
- Includes **file/print sharing**, browsing, session setup, and authentication in one protocol.
- Higher **protocol overhead** and **chattiness**, but feature-rich in managed Windows environments.

#### 🧠 **AFS (Andrew File System)**
- Designed for **large-scale distributed networks** (e.g., universities, enterprises).
- **Highly stateful** with **client-side caching**, even supports **offline access**.
- Uses **callbacks** for invalidation — improves consistency and reduces server load.
- Supports **replication**, **volume management**, and **strong Kerberos authentication**.
- More complex to manage, but excellent scalability and consistency.
