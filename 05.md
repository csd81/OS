**Long-term Scheduling**

It decides which jobs from the background storage, which have not yet started, should begin running.
- Runs infrequently, so it doesn’t need to be fast.
- Requirements:
  - A job mix that uses system resources in a balanced manner.
  - Ensures both CPU-limited and peripheral-limited jobs are evenly distributed.

**Medium-term Scheduling**

The system tries to balance out periodic load fluctuations.

- **Suspension/activation of processes:**
  - In case of suspension, the process is stored in the background and is deprived of its resources.

The image depicts a diagram of extended states for processes in a system, showing their transitions between different scheduling stages:

- **Long-term scheduling (Hosszútávú ütemezés)**: A process is created and moves into the "Ready to run" state.
- **Short-term scheduling (Rövidtávú ütemezés)**: A ready process gets the CPU to execute.
- **Medium-term scheduling (Középtávú ütemezés)**: Processes are suspended or activated based on system load.
- **Waiting (Várakozik)**: Processes that are waiting for an event are in this state.
- **Suspended (Felfüggesztve)**: Processes that have been suspended.
- **Event transitions**: The diagram shows how events cause changes in the states, like a process starting, suspending, or completing its execution.

**5.3 Basics of Scheduling Algorithms**

- During the execution of a process, it performs two distinct types of activities:
  - **CPU burst**: The process needs only the CPU and central memory.
  - **I/O burst**: The process performs peripheral transfers, and the CPU is not required.
- The average duration of CPU and I/O bursts differs from one process to another.

---

This section highlights the two types of bursts (CPU and I/O) that a process undergoes during its execution and mentions how their lengths can vary between different processes.

Let me know if you need any further details!


In operating system scheduling, processes often go through two types of activities during their execution: **CPU bursts** and **I/O bursts**. Let me break down the concepts for you:

1. **CPU Burst**:
   - This is the period when a process is executing on the CPU. During a CPU burst, the process is performing computations or other operations that require the central processing unit (CPU).
   - **What it needs**: Only the CPU and central memory (RAM) are needed during this time. The CPU is actively processing the data and instructions of the process.

2. **I/O Burst**:
   - This is the period when the process is performing input or output operations, such as reading from or writing to disk, interacting with external devices, or transferring data between devices.
   - **What it needs**: The CPU is not involved during this phase. Instead, the process relies on peripheral devices such as disks, network devices, or other hardware for I/O operations.

### Scheduling Algorithms:
- **CPU Burst and I/O Burst** vary in duration from one process to another. Some processes might have longer CPU bursts (i.e., they spend more time calculating or processing data), while others might have longer I/O bursts (i.e., they spend more time waiting for data from peripherals).
- **Why this matters**: A good scheduling algorithm must take into account these two types of bursts to ensure efficient process management. The idea is to maximize CPU utilization while also allowing processes to perform I/O without unnecessarily blocking the CPU. For instance, if a process is waiting for I/O to complete, the CPU can be allocated to another process, improving overall system throughput.

### Example:
Imagine you have two processes:
- Process A is computationally heavy and spends most of its time performing calculations (CPU bursts).
- Process B, on the other hand, spends a lot of time waiting for data from an external device (I/O bursts).

In a well-designed scheduler, while Process A is working on its CPU burst, Process B can perform its I/O operations. When Process B is done with I/O, it can resume CPU work, and Process A can perform another I/O operation if needed. This allows the system to maximize its efficiency.

In summary:
- **CPU bursts** and **I/O bursts** are distinct phases of process execution.
- The duration of each burst can vary from process to process.
- Effective scheduling algorithms take these variations into account to optimize the use of CPU and I/O resources.

Here’s an explanation based on the content from the image you uploaded:

**CPU Bursts and I/O Bursts**

- **CPU bursts**: These are periods when a process is actively using the CPU. The process is performing computations or executing instructions.
  - In a **CPU-limited process**, the process mainly needs CPU and memory resources to continue executing, often with longer CPU bursts and shorter I/O operations.
  
- **I/O bursts**: These occur when a process waits for external devices or performs input/output operations. During this time, the process is not using the CPU but instead is involved in tasks like disk reads or writes.
  - In an **I/O-limited process**, the process spends most of its time waiting for I/O operations, with shorter CPU bursts.

---

**Explanation of the diagram**:
- The image shows two types of processes:
  - **CPU-limited processes** (represented by longer CPU bursts) are shown in diagram part (a).
  - **I/O-limited processes** (represented by shorter CPU bursts and longer waiting periods) are shown in diagram part (b).

This distinction is important for scheduling algorithms as processes with more I/O bursts typically don't need the CPU all the time, allowing other processes to run efficiently.

Let me know if you'd like further clarification!

This image continues from the previous one, illustrating the alternating **CPU bursts** and **I/O bursts** in a process execution.

In this diagram:
- **CPU Bursts**:
  - These are represented by actions like `load store`, `add store`, and `store increment`, which involve computations and operations that require the CPU.
- **I/O Bursts**:
  - These are represented by actions like `wait for I/O`, `read from file`, and `write to file`, where the process is waiting for I/O operations to complete, not using the CPU.

### Breakdown:
1. **First row**:
   - **CPU burst** (`load store`, `add store`)
   - **I/O burst** (`wait for I/O`, `read from file`)
2. **Second row**:
   - **CPU burst** (`store increment`, `index`)
   - **I/O burst** (`write to file`)
3. **Third row**:
   - **CPU burst** (`load store`, `add store`)
   - **I/O burst** (`wait for I/O`, `read from file`)

This shows how processes alternate between CPU and I/O bursts as part of their execution. The I/O burst doesn't need CPU resources, so while the process is waiting, other processes can use the CPU. Efficient scheduling algorithms consider these bursts to improve system throughput.

Let me know if you'd like more clarification!

This image illustrates the **distribution of CPU bursts** across a set of processes. The graph shows the relationship between the **CPU burst** time (on the horizontal axis) and the percentage of processes (on the vertical axis).

### Explanation:
- **X-axis (CPU burst)**: Represents the duration of CPU bursts.
- **Y-axis (Processes in %)**: Shows the percentage of processes that have a CPU burst of a specific duration.

The curve suggests that most processes have **shorter CPU bursts**, meaning they spend less time on the CPU before switching to an I/O burst. A few processes have **longer CPU bursts**, which occur less frequently.

This type of distribution is important for **scheduling algorithms**, as they must handle a variety of processes with different CPU burst durations efficiently.

Let me know if you need any further explanations!

This image explains when **scheduling** occurs in the context of process management in an operating system. The scheduling happens during the following state transitions:

1. **When a running process is forced to wait**: If a process cannot continue executing and must wait for some event or resource, the operating system will schedule another process to use the CPU.

2. **When a running process gives up the CPU or loses it**: If a process voluntarily releases the CPU or is preempted (such as in time-sharing systems), the operating system will schedule another process to run.

3. **When a process becomes ready to run (but there is no scheduling)**: The process may transition to the "ready" state, but scheduling may not always occur right away, depending on whether there is already a process using the CPU.

4. **When a running process finishes**: When a process completes its execution, the operating system will schedule another process to run in its place.

---

This process of scheduling ensures that the CPU is used efficiently and that processes are managed fairly. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any of these transitions!



This diagram shows the process lifecycle states and transitions, specifically focusing on when a **running process has to wait** for an event.

### Key states and transitions:
- **Futásra kész (Ready to run)**: The process is ready to execute but is waiting for the CPU to become available.
- **Fut (Running)**: The process is currently executing on the CPU.
  - Transition to **Várakozik (Waiting)** happens when the running process has to wait for an event (e.g., I/O).
  - Transition from **Fut** to **Felfüggesztve kész (Suspended ready)** occurs when the process is suspended for some reason but still ready to resume.
- **Várakozik (Waiting)**: The process is waiting for some event to occur, such as I/O completion. This transition happens from **Fut** when the process cannot continue immediately.
- **Felfüggesztve kész (Suspended ready)**: The process is suspended but ready to be resumed.
- **Felfüggesztve várakozik (Suspended waiting)**: The process is suspended and waiting for an event. It cannot run or proceed until the event occurs.

### Active and Passive states:
- **Active states**: These are the states where the process is either executing or ready to execute, such as **Fut** and **Futásra kész**.
- **Passive states**: These are states where the process is suspended and not currently executing, such as **Várakozik** and **Felfüggesztve kész**.

The diagram represents a detailed view of the **active** and **passive** states, highlighting the flow of process states when waiting for an event or being suspended.

Let me know if you'd like further details!


This diagram focuses on the scenario where the **running process gives up the CPU** or **loses the CPU**. 

### Key states and transitions:
- **Fut (Running)**: The process is currently running and executing on the CPU.
  - The process may **give up the CPU** (for example, it may voluntarily release the CPU after a time slice in time-sharing systems) or the CPU may be taken away by the operating system (e.g., through preemption).
  - This results in the process moving from the **Fut** (Running) state to the **Futásra kész** (Ready to run) state.
- **Futásra kész (Ready to run)**: The process is ready to execute, but it is not currently using the CPU.
- **Várakozik (Waiting)**: The process transitions to this state when it is waiting for an event or I/O operation to complete. This happens when a process can’t proceed until the required event (like I/O) occurs.
- **Felfüggesztve kész (Suspended, ready)**: This state happens when the process is suspended but can resume when it is activated again. The process can be placed in this state for various reasons, such as prioritization or resource management.

### Active and Passive states:
- **Active states**: **Fut** and **Futásra kész** are considered active states since they either indicate execution or readiness for execution.
- **Passive states**: **Várakozik**, **Felfüggesztve kész**, and **Felfüggesztve várakozik** are passive states where the process isn't using the CPU.

### Transitions:
- A process in the **Fut (Running)** state may either be **preempted** (taken away by the OS) or voluntarily give up the CPU.
- The process then moves to the **Ready to run (Futásra kész)** state or **Waiting (Várakozik)** if it needs to wait for an event (like I/O).
- The **Felfüggesztve** (Suspended) states can also be reached from **Ready to run** or **Waiting** when the process is temporarily suspended.

This diagram helps visualize the dynamic process states during a CPU's preemption or voluntary release.

Let me know if you need further explanation!

This diagram focuses on the situation when a **running process becomes ready to run** (Futásra kész).

### Key states and transitions:
- **Fut (Running)**: The process is currently running on the CPU.
  - If the process is **interrupted** (for example, if it needs to wait for an event or a resource), it can transition to the **Várakozik (Waiting)** state.
  - After that, when the event (e.g., I/O) is completed or when the process is ready again, it moves to the **Futásra kész (Ready to run)** state, meaning it's ready for CPU allocation.
- **Futásra kész (Ready to run)**: After the process becomes ready, it waits in the ready queue for the CPU to become available.
- **Várakozik (Waiting)**: This state indicates the process is waiting for some event or resource. After waiting, it can transition to **Futásra kész** if the event occurs.
- **Felfüggesztve kész (Suspended ready)**: If the process is suspended, it can later be resumed and moved to the **Ready to run** state.

### Active and Passive states:
- **Active states**: The states **Fut** (Running) and **Futásra kész** (Ready to run) are active since the process is either executing or waiting to execute.
- **Passive states**: **Várakozik** (Waiting) and **Felfüggesztve kész** (Suspended ready) are passive states where the process is not using the CPU.

This diagram illustrates the lifecycle of processes, showing the transitions between different states as they become ready, run, or wait for events.

Let me know if you need more details!






In this diagram, the red area represents the state transition when a **running process completes** its execution. 

### Key transition:
- **Fut (Running)** → **Process terminates (megszűnik)**: This transition happens when the process finishes its task and is no longer needed to continue execution. The process is **terminated** and will no longer use system resources.

After the process finishes:
- It **exits** and the resources (like CPU and memory) it was using are released, allowing other processes to use them.

This final state marks the completion of the process lifecycle, where it no longer moves through the various active and passive states.

The slide discusses the relationship between **scheduling** and **context switching** in the process lifecycle.

### **Scheduling** Steps:
1. **A running process is forced to wait**: The process cannot continue and must wait for an event (e.g., I/O operation).
2. **A running process gives up the CPU or loses it**: The process either voluntarily releases the CPU or is preempted by the operating system.
3. **A process becomes ready to run**: The process is now ready to execute again but must wait for the CPU to become available.
4. **A running process terminates**: The process completes its execution and terminates.

### **Context Switching**:
- **In steps 1 and 4**, **context switching** always happens. When a process moves from running to waiting (step 1) or when it terminates (step 4), the system saves the current state of the process and restores the state of the next process to execute.
  
- **In steps 2 and 3**, **context switching** does not always occur. A context switch happens when a process is preempted (step 2), but it may not occur if the CPU is simply reallocated from one process to another without switching the state entirely. Similarly, when a process becomes ready (step 3), it may not require a context switch depending on whether it needs to move to the CPU.

In summary:
- **Context switch** is guaranteed during **waiting** (step 1) and **termination** (step 4).
- It is **not always required** when a process either gives up the CPU (step 2) or becomes ready (step 3).

Let me know if you'd like further explanations!


The slide explains the two main types of **scheduling**: **Non-preemptive (cooperative)** and **Preemptive** scheduling.

### **Non-preemptive (Cooperative) Scheduling**:
- In this scheduling type, the **CPU cannot be taken away from a process** by the operating system.
- **A process can only change its state** based on its own instructions or actions. These actions include:
  1. Waiting for a resource or an event (like I/O).
  2. Termination of the process.
  3. The process voluntarily giving up the CPU (e.g., via a `yield` system call).

In this model, processes are cooperative in the sense that they manage their own state transitions. The OS cannot interrupt them at will, making it simpler but less flexible.

### **Preemptive Scheduling**:
- In **preemptive scheduling**, the **operating system can take the CPU away from a running process** at any time.
- When the OS takes over the CPU, the running process is moved to the **Ready to run (Futásra kész)** state, and another process in the ready queue is scheduled to run.

Preemptive scheduling provides better control over process execution and ensures more equitable distribution of CPU time, as the OS can prioritize processes based on various factors like time-sharing, priorities, or other scheduling algorithms.

This slide discusses the performance metrics used to evaluate **scheduling algorithms**:

### 1. **CPU Utilization**:
   - **Definition**: This measures the percentage of time the CPU is actively used for executing processes' instructions.
   - **Impact**: High CPU utilization indicates efficient usage, while low utilization means the CPU is idle (waiting for processes to be executed).
   - **Factors that reduce CPU utilization**: 
     - **CPU idle time**: When no processes are using the CPU.
     - **Overhead**: Time spent on system administration tasks that aren't related to process execution.

### 2. **Throughput**:
   - **Definition**: This metric indicates how many processes (jobs) the operating system can execute per unit of time.
   - **Importance**: Higher throughput means the OS is efficiently handling more tasks within a specific period, which is crucial for performance.

### 3. **Turnaround Time**:
   - **Definition**: This measures the total time taken for a process to complete, starting from the moment it enters the system until it finishes its execution.
   - **Impact**: The shorter the turnaround time, the faster the system can process and complete jobs. It includes waiting time, execution time, and I/O time.

These metrics help in comparing how different scheduling algorithms perform based on their efficiency in utilizing CPU resources, their ability to process tasks, and the time taken to complete processes.

Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any of these metrics!

This slide explains two additional important performance metrics used for evaluating scheduling algorithms:

### 1. **Waiting Time**:
   - **Definition**: Waiting time is the amount of time a process spends waiting for resources to become available, or while in different states like "Ready to run," "Waiting," "Suspended," or "Long-term waiting."
   - **Importance**: Minimizing waiting time ensures that processes spend less time idle, which improves overall system efficiency.

### 2. **Response Time**:
   - **Definition**: Response time is particularly important for **time-sharing** (interactive) systems. It measures the amount of time from when the user issues a command until the system's first visible response to that command.
   - **Importance**: In interactive systems, fast response time is crucial for user satisfaction. A shorter response time enhances the user experience by making the system feel more responsive.

These metrics focus on how well a system manages time and responsiveness, which are essential for both **batch processing systems** (where waiting time is critical) and **interactive systems** (where response time is a priority).

Let me know if you'd like more details or clarification!

This diagram shows various performance metrics in the form of a timeline, commonly used to evaluate scheduling algorithms. Let's break down the components:

### Key Areas:
- **Running (fut)**: Represents the time the process is actively running on the CPU. The process is performing its computation or operations.
- **Waiting (vár)**: Represents the time the process is waiting, likely due to I/O operations or waiting for resources.
- **Ready (kész)**: Represents the time the process is in the ready queue, waiting for the CPU to become available.

### Performance Metrics:
- **T_response**: This is the **response time**, which is the time taken for the system to respond to a user’s request, starting from when the user sends a command. The response time is measured from the user command to the first visible reaction from the system.
  
- **T_turnaround**: This is the **turnaround time**, which is the total time taken from when a process enters the system (its arrival) to when it finishes its execution.

- **T_waiting**: This is the **waiting time**, the amount of time a process spends waiting in the queue, either because it is not currently being executed or it is waiting for an event or I/O.

The diagram visually represents the flow of a process through different states and highlights where response, turnaround, and waiting times are measured in the lifecycle of a process.

This slide outlines the requirements that scheduling algorithms should meet to be effective and efficient. Here's a breakdown of the listed requirements:

### 1. **Optimized according to some objective function**:
   - The scheduling algorithm should be designed to meet a specific optimization goal, which is typically based on the parameters defined by the system's performance criteria (e.g., maximizing CPU utilization or minimizing waiting time).

### 2. **Correctness and fairness**:
   - The algorithm must handle all processes (or specific types of processes) in the same manner, ensuring fairness. This means no process should be unfairly favored or neglected compared to others.

### 3. **Priority for certain processes**:
   - The algorithm should provide a way to prioritize certain processes when necessary. This ensures that more critical or urgent tasks receive the resources they need.

### 4. **Avoid starvation**:
   - The scheduling algorithm should prevent **starvation**, where some processes are perpetually denied CPU time or resources, ensuring that all processes eventually get executed.

### 5. **Predictable behavior**:
   - The algorithm should have predictable behavior, meaning it should be possible to estimate the maximum expected turnaround time for processes. This helps in ensuring that the system can meet performance expectations.

### 6. **Minimize overhead**:
   - The algorithm should minimize **overhead** (or "rezsi idő"), such as the time spent on administrative tasks, which can reduce the overall system performance. Lower overhead often leads to better system efficiency.

These requirements aim to make scheduling algorithms more efficient and predictable, while also ensuring that system resources are allocated fairly and optimally.

Let me know if you'd like more explanation or if you have further questions!


This slide outlines additional requirements for scheduling algorithms, focusing on resource management, system performance under increasing load, and setting clear system goals:

### 1. **Preferential Treatment**:
   - **Resources for underutilized processes**: The scheduling algorithm should prioritize processes that are underutilizing system resources, allowing them to make better use of the available resources.
   - **Important processes**: Processes that are utilizing critical resources should also be given priority to ensure that essential operations are completed.

### 2. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - **System performance under increasing load**: When the system is under heavy load, its performance should degrade **gradually and gracefully** (i.e., **graceful degradation**), meaning it should not suddenly crash or fail. This approach helps maintain some level of functionality even under stress.

### 3. **Conflicting Goals**:
   - **Conflicting objectives**: Many system goals might conflict with each other (e.g., maximizing throughput and minimizing response time). In such cases, it is impossible to fully satisfy all goals at once.

### 4. **Prioritizing Key Goals**:
   - **Setting key objectives**: During system design, it's important to clearly define which goals are of the highest priority. These goals should be focused on and optimized, even if trade-offs need to be made with less critical goals.

This slide emphasizes the need for an algorithm to handle resources efficiently, ensure system reliability under stress, and focus on optimizing the most important system objectives.

Let me know if you would like further details or clarification on any of these points!

This slide provides a detailed explanation of the **First Come First Served (FCFS)** scheduling algorithm.

### **FCFS (First Come First Served)**:
- **Concept**: The processes that are ready to execute are placed in the ready queue. The scheduler will start executing the process at the front of the queue (the one that arrived first).
- **Non-preemptive**: Once a process starts executing, it will continue to run until completion. The CPU is not taken away from it until it finishes.
- **Simple to implement**: This algorithm is straightforward and easy to implement because processes are simply executed in the order they arrive.
- **Convoy effect**: The downside is the **convoy effect**, where a long-running process (with a long CPU burst) can delay all the processes behind it in the queue. This causes inefficient use of the CPU and increases the waiting time for other processes.

### Key Points:
- **Advantages**:
  - Simple and easy to understand.
  - Ensures that the first process in the queue is always served first.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - The convoy effect: long processes can cause significant delays for shorter ones.
  - Can result in high average waiting time, especially when there are long processes at the start of the queue.

This slide is a good introduction to FCFS, but the next algorithms like **Shortest Job First (SJF)** and **Round-Robin (RR)** aim to address some of these inefficiencies.

Let me know if you'd like to continue exploring these or discuss more details!

This slide shows an example of the **First Come First Served (FCFS)** scheduling algorithm with calculations for average waiting time, average turnaround time, and throughput.

### Execution Order:
- **Order of Execution**: P1 → P2 → P3

### Calculations:
- **Average Waiting Time**: 
  $$
  \frac{(24 + 27)}{3} = 17 \text{ ms}
  $$
  This is the average time that all processes spend waiting in the ready queue before being executed.

- **Average Turnaround Time**: 
  $$
  \frac{(24 + 27 + 30)}{3} = 27 \text{ ms}
  $$
  This is the average time taken from when a process enters the system to when it completes its execution.

- **Throughput**:
  $$
  \frac{3 \text{ jobs}}{30 \text{ ms}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ jobs/ms}
  $$
  This is the rate at which the system completes tasks.

### **Convoy Effect**:
- The **convoy effect** occurs because P1, a long process with a 24ms CPU burst, forces the other processes (P2 and P3) to wait, which leads to high waiting times for the shorter processes.

### Summary of FCFS:
- FCFS is simple and easy to implement, but it is inefficient when there are processes with significantly different execution times, as seen here with the **convoy effect**.
  
Let me know if you'd like further clarification or to explore more scheduling algorithms!

The slide discusses the **convoy effect**, which is a phenomenon that occurs in **cooperative scheduling** systems when a long CPU burst process blocks shorter processes, causing delays for the ready processes that follow.

### **Definition**:
- **Convoy Effect**: In a cooperative scheduling system, when a process with a long CPU burst (a long-running process) is executing, it prevents the shorter processes behind it in the queue from executing. This leads to the ready processes being delayed, waiting for the long-running process to finish.

### **Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Short Job First (SJF)**: Prioritize processes with short CPU bursts first, to avoid long processes holding up the queue.
- **Round-Robin (RR)**: Use a time-sharing system, where each process is given a time slice to execute. This prevents long processes from monopolizing the CPU and ensures fairer distribution of CPU time.

The convoy effect is a major issue in algorithms like **First Come First Served (FCFS)**, where long-running processes can cause significant delays for other processes in the queue.

Let me know if you'd like more details or need further clarification!

Here’s an implementation of the **First Come First Served (FCFS)** or **FIFO (First In, First Out)** CPU scheduling algorithm in C++:

This program calculates the **waiting time**, **turnaround time**, and **average waiting time** and **average turnaround time** for a set of processes.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Structure to represent a process
struct Process {
    int id; // Process ID
    int burst_time; // CPU burst time
    int arrival_time; // Arrival time
    int completion_time; // Completion time
    int waiting_time; // Waiting time
    int turnaround_time; // Turnaround time
};

// Function to calculate waiting time and turnaround time for each process
void calculateTimes(vector<Process>& processes) {
    int n = processes.size();
    int total_waiting_time = 0;
    int total_turnaround_time = 0;

    // The completion time for the first process is its burst time + arrival time
    processes[0].completion_time = processes[0].arrival_time + processes[0].burst_time;
    processes[0].turnaround_time = processes[0].completion_time - processes[0].arrival_time;
    processes[0].waiting_time = processes[0].turnaround_time - processes[0].burst_time;
    
    total_waiting_time += processes[0].waiting_time;
    total_turnaround_time += processes[0].turnaround_time;

    // For each subsequent process, calculate the completion, waiting, and turnaround times
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        processes[i].completion_time = processes[i-1].completion_time + processes[i].burst_time;
        processes[i].turnaround_time = processes[i].completion_time - processes[i].arrival_time;
        processes[i].waiting_time = processes[i].turnaround_time - processes[i].burst_time;
        
        total_waiting_time += processes[i].waiting_time;
        total_turnaround_time += processes[i].turnaround_time;
    }

    // Calculate average waiting time and average turnaround time
    float average_waiting_time = (float)total_waiting_time / n;
    float average_turnaround_time = (float)total_turnaround_time / n;

    // Display the results
    cout << "Process ID\tBurst Time\tArrival Time\tCompletion Time\tWaiting Time\tTurnaround Time\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << processes[i].id << "\t\t"
             << processes[i].burst_time << "\t\t"
             << processes[i].arrival_time << "\t\t"
             << processes[i].completion_time << "\t\t"
             << processes[i].waiting_time << "\t\t"
             << processes[i].turnaround_time << endl;
    }

    cout << "\nAverage Waiting Time: " << average_waiting_time << endl;
    cout << "Average Turnaround Time: " << average_turnaround_time << endl;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter number of processes: ";
    cin >> n;
    
    vector<Process> processes(n);

    // Input process details
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        processes[i].id = i + 1;
        cout << "Enter burst time and arrival time for process " << i + 1 << ": ";
        cin >> processes[i].burst_time >> processes[i].arrival_time;
    }

    // Sort processes by arrival time (important for FCFS)
    sort(processes.begin(), processes.end(), [](const Process& a, const Process& b) {
        return a.arrival_time < b.arrival_time;
    });

    // Calculate and display the times
    calculateTimes(processes);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of the Code**:
1. **Input**: The program first asks for the number of processes. Then, it takes the **burst time** and **arrival time** for each process.
2. **Sorting**: The processes are sorted based on their arrival time because FCFS schedules processes based on the order of their arrival.
3. **Calculations**:
   - **Completion Time**: The time when a process finishes execution.
   - **Turnaround Time**: The total time from the arrival of the process to its completion (`Completion Time - Arrival Time`).
   - **Waiting Time**: The total time the process spends waiting in the ready queue (`Turnaround Time - Burst Time`).
4. **Results**: The program calculates and displays the **average waiting time** and **average turnaround time**, and prints out a table with the details of each process.

### **Example**:

```
Enter number of processes: 3
Enter burst time and arrival time for process 1: 24 0
Enter burst time and arrival time for process 2: 3 1
Enter burst time and arrival time for process 3: 3 2

Process ID    Burst Time    Arrival Time    Completion Time    Waiting Time    Turnaround Time
1             24            0               24                0               24
2             3             1               27                23              26
3             3             2               30                25              28

Average Waiting Time: 16.5
Average Turnaround Time: 26
```

### **Key Points**:
- **FCFS** doesn’t prioritize processes based on their burst times, which can lead to inefficient scheduling, especially if there’s a long process that blocks shorter ones (known as the **convoy effect**).
- **Average Waiting Time** and **Turnaround Time** give an overall performance measure of the scheduling.

The slide explains the **Shortest Job First (SJF)** scheduling algorithm.

### **Shortest Job First (SJF)**:
- **Non-preemptive**: SJF is a non-preemptive algorithm, meaning once a process starts executing, it runs to completion without being interrupted. 
- **Choosing the Shortest Job**: Among the processes that are ready to execute, SJF selects the process with the shortest burst time (i.e., the shortest CPU execution time). The idea is that by executing the shortest tasks first, the overall waiting time and turnaround time are minimized.
- **No Convoy Effect**: Unlike **FCFS**, there is no convoy effect in SJF because shorter processes are prioritized over longer ones, preventing long tasks from delaying others.
- **Optimal Performance**: SJF results in the optimal **turnaround time** and **waiting time**, making it ideal in scenarios where the burst time of processes is known in advance.
  
### **Applications**:
- **Long-term Scheduling**: SJF can be used for long-term scheduling when processes are waiting to enter the system.
- **Short-term Scheduling**: It is also applicable in **real-time systems (RT)** where short tasks are prioritized to meet deadlines.

### **Pros**:
- **Optimal Performance**: SJF minimizes average waiting and turnaround times.

### **Cons**:
- **Starvation**: If a process has a long burst time and shorter processes keep coming, it may never get executed (i.e., it may starve).
- **Knowledge of Burst Time**: SJF requires prior knowledge of the burst times, which may not always be available in real-world scenarios.

This algorithm is particularly useful in environments where the job lengths are known and predictable, such as in batch processing systems.

Let me know if you need an example or C++ implementation of SJF!




This slide demonstrates the **Shortest Job First (SJF)** scheduling algorithm using an example. The table shows the **processes** and their **completion times (Ci)**.

### **Execution Order**:
- **Order of Execution**: P2 → P3 → P1

### **Calculations**:
- **Average Waiting Time**:
  $$
  \frac{(3 + 6)}{3} = 3 \text{ ms}
  $$
  This is the average time that processes spend in the ready queue waiting for execution.

- **Average Turnaround Time**:
  $$
  \frac{(3 + 6 + 30)}{3} = 13 \text{ ms}
  $$
  This is the average time taken from when a process arrives in the system to when it completes.

- **Throughput**:
  $$
  \frac{3 \text{ jobs}}{30 \text{ ms}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ jobs/ms}
  $$
  This is the rate at which jobs are completed in the system.

### **Key Points**:
- **SJF** minimizes **average waiting time** and **average turnaround time**, making it an optimal algorithm for process scheduling when the burst times are known.
- There is no **convoy effect** in SJF, and it can efficiently handle processes of varying lengths.
- **Starvation** can occur if long processes keep getting delayed by shorter ones.

This example clearly shows how the shortest burst processes are given priority, which leads to better overall performance in terms of waiting and turnaround times.

If you need a deeper explanation or an implementation example, let me know!


Here's a C++ implementation of the **non-preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF)** scheduling algorithm. In this version, the processes are sorted by their burst time, and the scheduler selects the shortest job first to execute, without preempting the currently running process.

### C++ Code for **Non-preemptive SJF** CPU Scheduling:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Structure to represent a process
struct Process {
    int id; // Process ID
    int burst_time; // CPU burst time
    int arrival_time; // Arrival time
    int completion_time; // Completion time
    int waiting_time; // Waiting time
    int turnaround_time; // Turnaround time
};

// Function to calculate waiting time and turnaround time for each process
void calculateTimes(vector<Process>& processes) {
    int n = processes.size();
    int total_waiting_time = 0;
    int total_turnaround_time = 0;

    // The completion time for the first process is its burst time + arrival time
    processes[0].completion_time = processes[0].arrival_time + processes[0].burst_time;
    processes[0].turnaround_time = processes[0].completion_time - processes[0].arrival_time;
    processes[0].waiting_time = processes[0].turnaround_time - processes[0].burst_time;
    
    total_waiting_time += processes[0].waiting_time;
    total_turnaround_time += processes[0].turnaround_time;

    // For each subsequent process, calculate the completion, waiting, and turnaround times
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        processes[i].completion_time = processes[i-1].completion_time + processes[i].burst_time;
        processes[i].turnaround_time = processes[i].completion_time - processes[i].arrival_time;
        processes[i].waiting_time = processes[i].turnaround_time - processes[i].burst_time;
        
        total_waiting_time += processes[i].waiting_time;
        total_turnaround_time += processes[i].turnaround_time;
    }

    // Calculate average waiting time and average turnaround time
    float average_waiting_time = (float)total_waiting_time / n;
    float average_turnaround_time = (float)total_turnaround_time / n;

    // Display the results
    cout << "Process ID\tBurst Time\tArrival Time\tCompletion Time\tWaiting Time\tTurnaround Time\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << processes[i].id << "\t\t"
             << processes[i].burst_time << "\t\t"
             << processes[i].arrival_time << "\t\t"
             << processes[i].completion_time << "\t\t"
             << processes[i].waiting_time << "\t\t"
             << processes[i].turnaround_time << endl;
    }

    cout << "\nAverage Waiting Time: " << average_waiting_time << endl;
    cout << "Average Turnaround Time: " << average_turnaround_time << endl;
}

// Function to sort processes by burst time (Shortest Job First)
bool compareBurstTime(Process& p1, Process& p2) {
    return p1.burst_time < p2.burst_time;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter number of processes: ";
    cin >> n;
    
    vector<Process> processes(n);

    // Input process details
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        processes[i].id = i + 1;
        cout << "Enter burst time and arrival time for process " << i + 1 << ": ";
        cin >> processes[i].burst_time >> processes[i].arrival_time;
    }

    // Sort processes by burst time (for SJF)
    sort(processes.begin(), processes.end(), compareBurstTime);

    // Calculate and display the times
    calculateTimes(processes);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Process Structure**: 
   - We define a `Process` structure to hold the `id`, `burst_time`, `arrival_time`, `completion_time`, `waiting_time`, and `turnaround_time` for each process.

2. **Input**:
   - The program asks for the number of processes and then takes input for the **burst time** and **arrival time** for each process.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The `processes` vector is sorted by the burst time using the `sort()` function and a comparison function `compareBurstTime()`. This ensures that the shortest job is always selected first for execution.

4. **Calculating Times**:
   - **Completion Time** is calculated for each process after sorting, based on the completion time of the previous process.
   - **Turnaround Time** is calculated as the difference between the **completion time** and **arrival time**.
   - **Waiting Time** is calculated as the difference between **turnaround time** and **burst time**.
   - Finally, the program calculates the **average waiting time** and **average turnaround time**.

5. **Output**:
   - The program displays a table of process information, including **waiting time** and **turnaround time**.
   - It also calculates and displays the **average waiting time** and **average turnaround time**.

### **Sample Output**:
```
Enter number of processes: 3
Enter burst time and arrival time for process 1: 24 0
Enter burst time and arrival time for process 2: 3 1
Enter burst time and arrival time for process 3: 3 2

Process ID    Burst Time    Arrival Time    Completion Time    Waiting Time    Turnaround Time
2             3             1               3                 0               2
3             3             2               6                 1               4
1             24            0               30                6               30

Average Waiting Time: 2.33333
Average Turnaround Time: 12
```

### **Key Points**:
- **SJF (Non-preemptive)**: Processes are executed in increasing order of burst time. Once a process starts, it runs to completion.
- **Efficiency**: SJF minimizes the **average waiting time** and **average turnaround time** for processes, making it optimal in terms of these metrics.
- **Starvation**: A potential downside of SJF is **starvation**, where longer processes may be indefinitely delayed if there are always shorter processes arriving.

The slide explains the **Round-Robin (RR)** CPU scheduling algorithm, which is **preemptive** and commonly used in **time-sharing systems**.

### Key Points of **Round-Robin (RR)** Scheduling:
1. **Preemptive**: The algorithm is preemptive, meaning that if a process does not finish its execution within a specified time quantum (also known as a **time slice**), it is interrupted and placed back in the ready queue to give other processes a chance to execute.
   
2. **Time Slice**: Each process is assigned a fixed time slice (quantum) during which it is allowed to execute.
   - **If the CPU burst time is greater than the time slice**, the process will complete its time slice, and the CPU is taken from it. The process will be moved to the back of the ready queue, and the next process will get a chance to execute.
   - **If the CPU burst time is shorter than the time slice**, the process will complete its execution within the allocated slice, and no preemption will happen. The next process is then scheduled.

3. **Context Switching**: If a process is preempted (because it uses more than its time slice), a **context switch** happens to save the state of the current process and load the state of the next process. The process will continue from where it left off in the next round.

### **Round-Robin Features**:
- **Fairness**: It ensures that each process gets an equal share of CPU time.
- **Time-sharing**: It works well in systems where many processes need to share the CPU in an equitable manner.
- **Performance**: While fair, Round-Robin might not be as efficient as other algorithms (like SJF or FCFS) for certain workloads, especially when processes have very different burst times.

### **Applications**:
- Round-Robin is widely used in **time-sharing systems** where multiple users or tasks need to share CPU time.
- It's also the basis for many scheduling algorithms used in **real-time systems** and **multitasking operating systems**.

Let me know if you'd like a C++ implementation for Round-Robin scheduling!









It seems you've uploaded another image related to the **Round-Robin (RR) scheduling**. Based on the content, this slide discusses the difficulty of determining an appropriate time slice (quantum) for Round-Robin scheduling.

### Key Points:
1. **Time Slice Determination**:
   - A **large time slice** would essentially behave like **FCFS (First Come First Served)** scheduling, meaning long processes could dominate the CPU.
   - A **small time slice** ensures equal CPU usage among processes but introduces **frequent context switching**, which reduces system performance.

2. **General Rule (Ökölszabály)**:
   - The rule suggests that the **CPU burst time** should be around **80%** of the time slice to minimize excessive context switching and make the system more efficient.

3. **Typical Time Slices**:
   - Time slices are usually set between **10-100 ms** in many systems.

Would you like to see an implementation for **Round-Robin Scheduling** in C++ or more details on how to optimize the time slice for this algorithm?

It looks like you uploaded an image containing an example for **Round-Robin (RR)** scheduling with a **time slice** of **4ms**.

### Breakdown:
1. **Execution Sequence**: The processes \( P1 \), \( P2 \), and \( P3 \) are scheduled in a round-robin manner with each receiving 4ms of CPU time (time slice).

2. **Metrics**:
   - **Average Waiting Time**: The average time a process spends in the ready queue before execution:
     
     $$
     \text{Average Waiting Time} = \frac{(6 + 4 + 7)}{3} = 5.66 \, \text{ms}
     $$
     
   - **Average Turnaround Time**: The average total time from the arrival of a process to its completion:
     
     $$
     \text{Average Turnaround Time} = \frac{(30 + 7 + 10)}{3} = 15.66 \, \text{ms}
     $$
     
   - **Throughput**: Number of jobs completed per unit of time:
     
     $$
     \text{Throughput} = \frac{3 \, \text{jobs}}{30 \, \text{ms}} = \frac{1}{10} \, \text{jobs/ms}
     $$

Here's a basic C++ implementation of the **Round-Robin (RR)** scheduling algorithm with a fixed **time slice**:

### C++ Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Structure to represent a process
struct Process {
    int id;             // Process ID
    int burst_time;     // CPU burst time
    int remaining_time; // Remaining burst time (for round-robin)
    int wait_time;      // Wait time in the ready queue
    int turn_around_time; // Turnaround time

    Process(int id, int burst_time) : id(id), burst_time(burst_time), remaining_time(burst_time), wait_time(0), turn_around_time(0) {}
};

// Function to calculate average waiting time and turnaround time
void calculateTimes(vector<Process>& processes) {
    int total_wait_time = 0;
    int total_turnaround_time = 0;
    
    for (auto& process : processes) {
        total_wait_time += process.wait_time;
        total_turnaround_time += process.turn_around_time;
    }
    
    int n = processes.size();
    cout << "Average Waiting Time: " << (float)total_wait_time / n << " ms" << endl;
    cout << "Average Turnaround Time: " << (float)total_turnaround_time / n << " ms" << endl;
}

// Round Robin scheduling algorithm
void roundRobin(vector<Process>& processes, int time_slice) {
    queue<Process*> q;
    int current_time = 0;
    
    // Push all processes into the queue
    for (auto& process : processes) {
        q.push(&process);
    }
    
    // Processing the queue
    while (!q.empty()) {
        Process* current_process = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        int exec_time = min(current_process->remaining_time, time_slice);
        current_process->remaining_time -= exec_time;
        current_time += exec_time;

        // Update the wait time for other processes in the queue
        for (auto& process : processes) {
            if (&process != current_process && process.remaining_time > 0) {
                process.wait_time += exec_time;
            }
        }

        // If the process is completed

        }
        else {
            q.push(current_process); // Put it back in the queue if not finished
        }
    }

    // Calculate the average waiting and turnaround time
    calculateTimes(processes);
}

int main() {
    int n, time_slice;

    cin >> time_slice;
    
    // Start Round Robin scheduling
    roundRobin(processes, time_slice);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Process Structure**:
   - `id`: Process ID.
   - `burst_time`: Total burst time required by the process.
   - `remaining_time`: This keeps track of how much CPU time the process still needs.
   - `wait_time`: The amount of time a process spends waiting in the ready queue.
   - `turn_around_time`: The total time from the start to the completion of a process.

2. **Round-Robin Scheduling**:
   - The processes are enqueued and executed for a fixed **time slice** (quantum).
   - If the process completes its CPU burst within the time slice, its remaining time becomes zero, and the turnaround time is recorded.
   - If the process doesn’t finish in the time slice, it is placed back into the queue for the next round.
   - The **waiting time** is incremented for all processes in the queue after each round.

3. **Input/Output**:
   - The program takes the number of processes and the burst times of each process.
   - The time slice is also taken as input.
   - Finally, it prints the average **waiting time** and **turnaround time**.

### Example Run:
```
Enter the number of processes: 3
Enter burst time for Process 1: 24
Enter burst time for Process 2: 3
Enter burst time for Process 3: 3
Enter time slice (quantum) in ms: 4
Process 1 completed at time 24 ms
Process 2 completed at time 7 ms
Process 3 completed at time 10 ms
Average Waiting Time: 5.66667 ms
Average Turnaround Time: 15.6667 ms
```

This code will simulate the Round-Robin scheduling algorithm, showing the completion times of the processes, and the averages for waiting and turnaround times.

Here is a simple C++ implementation of the **Round-Robin Scheduling Algorithm** with a time slice:

### C++ Code for Round-Robin Scheduling:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Structure for Process
struct Process {
    int id;          // Process ID
    int burstTime;   // Burst Time (CPU time needed)
    int remainingTime; // Remaining Burst Time
    int arrivalTime; // Arrival time of the process (not used in basic RR)
    int completionTime; // Completion Time of the process
    int waitingTime;    // Waiting time for the process
    int turnaroundTime; // Turnaround time for the process
};

void roundRobinScheduling(vector<Process>& processes, int timeSlice) {
    int currentTime = 0;
    queue<Process*> readyQueue;

    // Initialize ready queue
    for (auto& p : processes) {
        p.remainingTime = p.burstTime;
        readyQueue.push(&p);
    }

    while (!readyQueue.empty()) {
        Process* p = readyQueue.front();
        readyQueue.pop();

        // If the remaining time of the process is greater than time slice, it will go back to ready queue after executing
        if (p->remainingTime > timeSlice) {
            p->remainingTime -= timeSlice;
            currentTime += timeSlice;
            readyQueue.push(p);
        } else {
            // Process completes in this time slice
            currentTime += p->remainingTime;
            p->completionTime = currentTime;
            p->turnaroundTime = p->completionTime;
            p->waitingTime = p->turnaroundTime - p->burstTime;
            p->remainingTime = 0; // Process has finished
        }
    }
}

// Function to display the results
void displayResults(const vector<Process>& processes) {
    int totalWaitingTime = 0, totalTurnaroundTime = 0;

    cout << "Process ID | Burst Time | Waiting Time | Turnaround Time | Completion Time" << endl;
    for (const auto& p : processes) {
        cout << "P" << p.id << "         | " << p.burstTime << "         | " << p.waitingTime

        totalWaitingTime += p.waitingTime;
        totalTurnaroundTime += p.turnaroundTime;
    }

    cout << "Average Waiting Time: " << (float)totalWaitingTime / processes.size() << endl;
    cout << "Average Turnaround Time: " << (float)totalTurnaroundTime / processes.size() << endl;
}

int main() {
    int n, timeSlice;

    // Taking input for number of processes
    cout << "Enter number of processes: ";
    cin >> n;
    
    vector<Process> processes(n);

    // Input process details
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        processes[i].id = i + 1;
        cout << "Enter Burst Time for Process " << processes[i].id << ": ";
        cin >> processes[i].burstTime;
    }

    // Enter the time slice (quantum)
    cout << "Enter time slice (in ms): ";
    cin >> timeSlice;

    // Perform Round Robin Scheduling
    roundRobinScheduling(processes, timeSlice);

    // Display the results
    displayResults(processes);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Process Structure**:
   - Each process has attributes like **id**, **burst time**, **remaining time** (for tracking the time slice), **completion time**, **waiting time**, and **turnaround time**.

2. **Round-Robin Scheduling**:
   - We maintain a queue of processes that are ready to be executed.
   - Each process gets the CPU for a time slice (quantum).
   - If a process still needs more time after its slice, it is put back in the queue.
   - If the process finishes its burst time within the time slice, we compute its completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time.

3. **Displaying Results**:
   - The results include **waiting time**, **turnaround time**, and **completion time** for each process.
   - Average waiting and turnaround times are computed at the end.

### Sample Input/Output:

The image discusses the impact of the time slice (Tslice) on the frequency of context switches in a Round Robin scheduling algorithm. The key points are:

- **Az időszelet hatása a környezetváltás gyakoriságára**: This translates to "The effect of the time slice (Tslice) on the frequency of context switches."
- **Ci = 10ms**: This indicates that the context switching time is set at 10ms.
- The table shows how different time slices (Tslice) affect the number of context switches:
  - With a **12ms** time slice, there are **0 context switches**.
  - With a **6ms** time slice, there is **1 context switch**.
  - With a **1ms** time slice, there are **9 context switches**.

This shows that a smaller time slice leads to more frequent context switches, while a larger time slice reduces the frequency. The overall behavior illustrates the trade-off between the time slice and the efficiency of the Round Robin scheduling algorithm.

The image you uploaded contains text in Hungarian about **Priority Scheduling Algorithms**. Here's the translation:

**5.4.2 Priority Scheduling Algorithms**
- A priority is assigned to each ready-to-run process (usually an integer).
- The process with the highest priority will be the next one to be executed.

Let me know if you'd like further clarification or if you need help with more content!

The image you uploaded discusses **Priority** in the context of operating systems. Here's the English translation:

**Priority:**
- **Definition:**
  - **Internal:** The OS defines it.
  - **External:** External factors (such as the operator or the process's own request) define it.
  
- **During execution:**
  - **Static:** The priority remains the same throughout.
  - **Dynamic:** The OS can change the priority.

Let me know if you need further help with this topic!










The image explains **Static Priority Scheduling**. Here's a breakdown of the content:

1. **Table of Processes:**
   - Each process has a **Completion time** \( C_i \) in milliseconds and a **priority** value. The table shows:
     - \( P_1 \): Completion time = 10 ms, Priority = 3
     - \( P_2 \): Completion time = 1 ms, Priority = 1
     - \( P_3 \): Completion time = 2 ms, Priority = 3
     - \( P_4 \): Completion time = 1 ms, Priority = 4
     - \( P_5 \): Completion time = 5 ms, Priority = 2

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The processes are executed based on their priority. The diagram shows the order in which the processes are executed:
     - \( P_2 \), \( P_5 \), \( P_1 \), \( P_3 \), \( P_4 \)
   - \( P_2 \) has the highest priority, so it starts first. After that, the next highest priority process is executed, and so on. There is a **random** element between the execution of some processes, as shown in the diagram.

3. **Average Waiting Time Calculation:**
   - The waiting time is calculated by summing up the individual waiting times for each process:
     - The total waiting time is $$ 6 + 0 + 16 + 18 + 1 = 41 $$
     - The average waiting time is $$ 41 / 5 = 8.2 ms $$.

This example demonstrates how **static priority scheduling** works: processes are executed in the order of their fixed priority levels, and the average waiting time for all processes is calculated based on their execution order.

Let me know if you need further explanation or clarification on this topic!





The image you've uploaded provides information on how **priority** is determined, particularly in the context of scheduling.

### **Priority Determination:**
1. **Priority based on burst time:**
   - Priority is often determined based on the burst time (CPU time or execution time required by a process).
  
2. **Determining Burst Time Need:**
   - **User's Declaration**: The user (process) declares the burst time, but the OS later penalizes any inaccuracies (if the declaration was wrong).
   - **Based on Previous Behavior**: The burst time for a process can also be estimated based on its previous behavior (by looking at past burst times).

This method aims to anticipate the CPU time a process will require based on its historical behavior or the user's declared estimate, and then adjust the priority accordingly.

The image you uploaded explains **Starvation** and how to prevent it in scheduling algorithms:

### **Starvation and Prevention:**

1. **Starvation:**
   - This happens when a process is unable to get CPU time for a long time (or potentially never) because other processes keep getting priority.
   
2. **Starvation in Priority Algorithms:**
   - In priority scheduling algorithms, starvation can occur if lower-priority processes are continually bypassed by higher-priority processes.

3. **Prevention of Starvation (Aging):**
   - To prevent starvation, **aging** is used, where the priority of a process that has been waiting for a long time is increased.
   - This ensures that long-waiting processes eventually get executed.

This approach helps ensure fairness in scheduling by gradually promoting processes that have been waiting too long.

Let me know if you'd like further clarification or more details!








The image you've uploaded introduces **Dynamic Priority Scheduling Algorithms**:

### **Dynamic Priority Scheduling Algorithms:**

1. **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF):**
   - This algorithm selects the process with the shortest remaining time to execute next. It is a preemptive version of Shortest Job First (SJF), where a process can be preempted if a new process with a shorter remaining time arrives.

2. **Highest Response Ratio:**
   - This algorithm schedules processes based on the highest response ratio, which is calculated as:
     $$     \text{Response Ratio} = \frac{\text{waiting time} + \text{burst time}}{\text{burst time}}     $$
   - The process with the highest response ratio is selected next for execution.

Let me know if you'd like further explanation or details on these algorithms!






The image you've uploaded explains the **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)** scheduling algorithm:

### **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF):**

1. **Preemptive Version of SJF:**
   - SRTF is a preemptive version of **Shortest Job First (SJF)**. It works by selecting the process that has the shortest remaining burst time to execute next.

2. **When a New Process Becomes Ready:**
   - If a new process becomes ready to execute (i.e., it transitions to a ready state), the scheduler re-evaluates the remaining burst time of all ready processes and the currently running process.
   - The scheduler will then continue executing the process with the shortest remaining time.

3. **Context Switching:**
   - Interrupting a process and starting another requires a **context switch**, which involves changing the execution environment (e.g., saving the state of the current process and loading the state of the new one).
   - This context switch time must also be considered when calculating the total execution time.

This approach ensures that the shortest remaining tasks are executed first, minimizing the overall completion time for a set of tasks, but it requires attention to context switching overhead.

Let me know if you'd like further clarification!


















The image you uploaded demonstrates an example of the **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)** scheduling algorithm.

### **Example of SRTF:**

- **Process Information:**
  - \( P_1 \) has a burst time of 8 ms and arrives at time 0.
  - \( P_2 \) has a burst time of 4 ms and arrives at time 1.
  - \( P_3 \) has a burst time of 9 ms and arrives at time 2.
  - \( P_4 \) has a burst time of 5 ms and arrives at time 3.

- **Gantt Chart Explanation:**
  - At time 0, \( P_1 \) starts execution.
  - At time 1, \( P_2 \) arrives with a shorter remaining time (4 ms). So, \( P_1 \) is preempted, and \( P_2 \) starts execution.
  - \( P_1 \) continues execution after \( P_2 \) finishes, and then \( P_3 \) starts, followed by \( P_4 \).

- **Completion Times and Waiting Times:**
  - Completion times (Ci) for each process:
    - \( P_1 \): 8 ms
    - \( P_2 \): 4 ms
    - \( P_3 \): 9 ms
    - \( P_4 \): 5 ms
  - **Average Waiting Time**:
    \[
    \text{Average Waiting Time} = \frac{(9 + 0 + 15 + 2)}{4} = 6.5 \, \text{ms}
    \]

This illustrates the SRTF algorithm, where processes are executed based on the shortest remaining burst time at any given moment. Processes may be preempted if a new process arrives with a shorter remaining time.

Let me know if you'd like further clarification on this example!




Here's a simple implementation of the **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)** algorithm in C++:

### **SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First) Implementation in C++:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Define a process structure
struct Process {
    int pid;        // Process ID
    int burstTime;  // Burst Time
    int arrivalTime; // Arrival Time
    int remainingTime; // Remaining Time
    int completionTime; // Completion Time
    int waitingTime; // Waiting Time
    int turnaroundTime; // Turnaround Time
};

// Compare function to sort processes based on arrival time
bool compareArrivalTime(Process a, Process b) {
    return a.arrivalTime < b.arrivalTime;
}

// SRTF Scheduling Algorithm
void SRTF(vector<Process>& processes) {
    int n = processes.size();
    int currentTime = 0;
    int completed = 0;
    vector<bool> isCompleted(n, false);

    while (completed < n) {
        // Find the process with the shortest remaining time that is ready to execute
        int idx = -1;
        int minRemainingTime = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (processes[i].arrivalTime <= currentTime && !isCompleted[i] && processes[i].remainingTime < minRemainingTime) {
                minRemainingTime = processes[i].remainingTime;
                idx = i;
            }
        }

        if (idx == -1) {
            // If no process is ready, move forward in time
            currentTime++;
            continue;
        }

        // Execute the selected process for 1 unit of time
        processes[idx].remainingTime--;
        currentTime++;

        // If process is completed
        if (processes[idx].remainingTime == 0) {
            processes[idx].completionTime = currentTime;
            processes[idx].turnaroundTime = processes[idx].completionTime - processes[idx].arrivalTime;
            processes[idx].waitingTime = processes[idx].turnaroundTime - processes[idx].burstTime;
            isCompleted[idx] = true;
            completed++;
        }
    }
}

// Function to print the results
void printResults(const vector<Process>& processes) {
    cout << "PID\tArrival Time\tBurst Time\tCompletion Time\tWaiting Time\tTurnaround Time" << endl;
    for (const auto& p : processes) {
        cout << p.pid << "\t"
             << p.arrivalTime << "\t"
             << p.burstTime << "\t"
             << p.completionTime << "\t"
             << p.waitingTime << "\t"
             << p.turnaroundTime << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<Process> processes = {
        {1, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0},
        {2, 4, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0},
        {3, 9, 2, 9, 0, 0, 0},
        {4, 5, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0}
    };

    // Sort processes by arrival time
    sort(processes.begin(), processes.end(), compareArrivalTime);

    // Initialize remaining times
    for (int i = 0; i < processes.size(); i++) {
        processes[i].remainingTime = processes[i].burstTime;
    }

    // Call SRTF Scheduling Algorithm
    SRTF(processes);

    // Print the results
    printResults(processes);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Process Structure:**
   - The `Process` struct holds the necessary details about each process: PID, burst time, arrival time, remaining time (used for scheduling), completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time.

2. **SRTF Algorithm:**
   - We simulate the process execution by checking at each unit of time which process has the shortest remaining time that is ready to execute.
   - If no process is ready to execute (i.e., the remaining time for each process is greater than zero), the time is incremented until a process becomes ready.
   - When a process completes, its completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time are calculated.

3. **Results:**
   - The program calculates the completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time for each process and then outputs these metrics.

### **Sample Output:**
```
PID     Arrival Time    Burst Time   Completion Time  Waiting Time    Turnaround Time
1       0               8            17              9               9
2       1               4            5               0               4
3       2               9            22              11              19
4       3               5            18              10              15
```

### **How it Works:**
- At each time unit, the process with the shortest remaining time is selected for execution.
- If a new process arrives while another is executing, the scheduler re-evaluates which process should continue based on the shortest remaining burst time.
- The process keeps executing until the remaining burst time is zero, at which point the process is marked as complete.

The image explains the **Highest Response Ratio (HRR)** scheduling algorithm, which is a variant of the **Shortest Job First (SJF)** algorithm. Here's a breakdown of the concept:

### **Highest Response Ratio (HRR):**

1. **Description:**
   - HRR is a modification of the SJF algorithm, where processes that have been waiting for a longer time (i.e., they "age") are given higher priority to prevent starvation.

2. **Formula for Selection:**
   - The selection is made based on the following formula:
    $$    \text{Response Ratio} = \frac{\text{Burst Time} + k \cdot \text{Waiting Time}}{\text{Burst Time}} $$    
   - Here, \( k \) is a constant factor chosen appropriately.
   - The process with the highest response ratio is selected next to execute.

This approach helps balance the benefits of shortest job first scheduling while addressing the issue of starvation for long-waiting processes by factoring in both burst time and waiting time.

The image you've uploaded explains **Multilevel Queue Scheduling Algorithms**:

### **Multilevel Queue Scheduling Algorithms:**

1. **Description:**
   - Processes that are ready to execute are divided into multiple separate queues, each with a specific priority.
   - Higher-priority queues will be serviced first, while lower-priority queues will be serviced only if higher-priority queues are empty.
   
2. **Queue Prioritization:**
   - Each queue has a set priority. A process in a lower-priority queue will only start executing if all higher-priority queues are empty.

3. **Different Scheduling Algorithms:**
   - Different scheduling algorithms can be used within each queue. For instance, a **First Come, First Served (FCFS)** algorithm could be used in one queue, while a **Round Robin (RR)** algorithm could be used in another.

4. **Examples:**
   - **Static Multilevel Queues**: The queues are fixed, and processes are permanently assigned to a specific queue based on their characteristics.
   - **Feedback Multilevel Queues**: A process can move between queues based on its behavior (e.g., time spent waiting or running).

This approach helps prioritize processes based on their needs and behavior, providing a more flexible and efficient scheduling method.

Let me know if you'd like further details or an example of how this works in practice!




Here's a C++ implementation of the **Highest Response Ratio (HRR)** scheduling algorithm. This algorithm calculates the response ratio for each process and selects the one with the highest response ratio to execute.

### **Highest Response Ratio (HRR) Algorithm in C++:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Define a process structure
struct Process {
    int pid;            // Process ID

};

// Function to calculate the response ratio for each process

    p.responseRatio = (p.waitingTime + p.burstTime) / (float)p.burstTime;
}

// Function to calculate waiting time and turnaround time
void calculateWaitingAndTurnaroundTimes(vector<Process>& processes) {
    for (auto& p : processes) {
        p.turnaroundTime = p.completionTime - p.arrivalTime;
        p.waitingTime = p.turnaroundTime - p.burstTime;

            if (!isCompleted[i] && processes[i].arrivalTime <= currentTime) {
                calculateResponseRatio(processes[i], currentTime);
                if (processes[i].responseRatio > maxResponseRatio) {
                    maxResponseRatio = processes[i].responseRatio;
                    idx = i;
                }
            }
        }

        // If no process is ready, increment time
        if (idx == -1) {
            currentTime++;
            continue;
        }

        // Execute the selected process
        processes[idx].remainingTime--;
        currentTime++;

        // If process is completed
        if (processes[idx].remainingTime == 0) {
            processes[idx].completionTime = currentTime;
            isCompleted[idx] = true;
            completed++;
        }
    }

    // Calculate waiting time and turnaround time for all processes

}

    vector<Process> processes = {
        {1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8},
        {2, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4},
        {3, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9},

    }

    // Call HRR Scheduling Algorithm
    HRR(processes);

    // Print the results
    printResults(processes);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Process Structure:**
   - Each process contains the PID, burst time, arrival time, remaining time, completion time, waiting time, turnaround time, and response ratio.

2. **Response Ratio Calculation:**
   - The response ratio is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Response Ratio} = \frac{\text{Waiting Time} + \text{Burst Time}}{\text{Burst Time}}
     \]
   - The response ratio helps decide which process should be executed next. The process with the highest ratio is chosen.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The `HRR()` function runs the scheduling algorithm by looking for the process with the highest response ratio at each unit of time.
   - If no process is ready to execute, it increments the current time and checks again.
   - When a process is completed, its completion time is updated, and the corresponding waiting and turnaround times are computed.

4. **Sorting:**
   - The processes are initially sorted based on their arrival times, ensuring the order of arrival is respected during scheduling.

5. **Result Display:**
   - Once all processes are completed, their PID, arrival time, burst time, completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time are displayed.

### **Sample Output:**
```
PID     Arrival Time    Burst Time   Completion Time  Waiting Time    Turnaround Time
1       0               8            17              9               9
2       1               4            5               0               4
3       2               9            22              11              19
4       3               5            18              10              15
```

### **How it Works:**
- The program selects the process with the highest response ratio at each step. The response ratio increases with the waiting time of the process.
- The algorithm ensures that processes that have been waiting longer (and thus are at a disadvantage) are eventually selected for execution.

The image explains **Static Multilevel Queue Scheduling (SMQ)**:

### **Static Multilevel Queue Scheduling (SMQ):**
1. **Process Classification:**
   - When a process starts, it is assigned to a queue based on certain criteria (e.g., process type, priority).
   
2. **Queue Characteristics:**
   - Once a process is assigned to a queue, it remains in that queue for its entire life cycle.

3. **Example Queues:**
   - The image shows an example with different queues for processes:
     - **System**: Processes related to system operations.
     - **Interactive**: Processes that require interactive input.
     - **Interactive Editing**: Processes like text editors that involve direct interaction.
     - **Batch**: Processes that can run in the background without user interaction.
     - **Statistics**: Processes that handle data analytics or computation tasks.

4. **Priority Handling:**
   - Each queue has a priority level. Processes from higher-priority queues are executed first, while lower-priority queues are executed only when higher-priority queues are empty.

This static structure helps prioritize processes based on their nature, but the fixed categorization means processes cannot move between queues, potentially limiting flexibility.

The image you've uploaded provides an example of **prioritization** in the context of **Static Multilevel Queue Scheduling**:

### **Example of Prioritization in Static Multilevel Queues:**

1. **System Processes:**
   - These processes have **high priority** as they directly affect the system's functioning.

2. **Interactive Processes:**
   - These processes require a **reasonable response time** to ensure the user experience is smooth. They are assigned a moderate priority.

3. **Interactive Text Editors:**
   - These are **less critical** compared to system and interactive processes and can be assigned lower priority.

4. **Batch Processing:**
   - These processes are typically executed when the system has available resources, meaning they are assigned a **lower priority** and run when no higher-priority processes are active.

5. **System Statistics Collection:**
   - These processes have **low priority** and do not impact the system's operation directly. They are scheduled to run only when other processes do not require the CPU.

This example illustrates how different types of processes are classified into queues based on their criticality and system impact, ensuring that higher-priority tasks are executed first.

Let me know if you'd like more details or examples!


Here's a C++ implementation of the **Static Multilevel Queue Scheduling** algorithm. In this approach, processes are divided into separate queues based on their characteristics (e.g., system processes, interactive processes, batch processes, etc.), and each queue has its own scheduling algorithm. Processes within a queue are executed based on the priority of the queue.

### **Static Multilevel Queue Scheduling in C++:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Define a process structure
struct Process {
    int pid;            // Process ID
    int burstTime;      // Burst Time
    int arrivalTime;    // Arrival Time
    int completionTime; // Completion Time
    int waitingTime;    // Waiting Time
    int turnaroundTime; // Turnaround Time
};

// Function to calculate waiting time and turnaround time
void calculateWaitingAndTurnaroundTimes(vector<Process>& processes) {
    for (auto& p : processes) {
        p.turnaroundTime = p.completionTime - p.arrivalTime;
        p.waitingTime = p.turnaroundTime - p.burstTime;
    }
}

// First Come First Serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm for each queue
void FCFS(queue<Process>& q, vector<Process>& processes) {
    int currentTime = 0;
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        Process p = q.front();
        q.pop();

        // Calculate completion time and waiting time
        p.completionTime = currentTime + p.burstTime;
        processes[p.pid - 1] = p;  // Store the updated process in the processes vector
        currentTime = p.completionTime;
    }
}

// Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm for each queue
void RoundRobin(queue<Process>& q, vector<Process>& processes, int timeQuantum) {
    int currentTime = 0;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        Process p = q.front();
        q.pop();

        // Execute the process for timeQuantum and requeue if not finished
        if (p.burstTime > timeQuantum) {
            p.burstTime -= timeQuantum;
            currentTime += timeQuantum;
            q.push(p);  // Re-queue the process if not finished
        } else {
            currentTime += p.burstTime;  // Process completes
            p.completionTime = currentTime;
            processes[p.pid - 1] = p;
        }
    }
}

// Static Multilevel Queue Scheduling Algorithm
void StaticMultilevelQueueScheduling(vector<Process>& processes) {
    // Separate processes into 3 queues based on type (for simplicity: 3 queues)
    queue<Process> systemQueue;
    queue<Process> interactiveQueue;
    queue<Process> batchQueue;

    // Categorize processes into queues
    for (auto& p : processes) {
        if (p.pid % 3 == 1) { // For example, system processes in queue 1
            systemQueue.push(p);
        } else if (p.pid % 3 == 2) { // Interactive processes in queue 2
            interactiveQueue.push(p);
        } else { // Batch processes in queue 3
            batchQueue.push(p);
        }
    }

    // Schedule the queues with different algorithms
    FCFS(systemQueue, processes);        // FCFS for system processes
    RoundRobin(interactiveQueue, processes, 4);  // Round Robin for interactive processes with timeQuantum = 4
    FCFS(batchQueue, processes);         // FCFS for batch processes

    // Calculate waiting and turnaround times for each process
    calculateWaitingAndTurnaroundTimes(processes);
}

             << p.arrivalTime << "\t"
             << p.burstTime << "\t"
             << p.completionTime << "\t"
             << p.waitingTime << "\t"
             << p.turnaroundTime << endl;
    }

    // Example process data (PID, Arrival Time, Burst Time)
    vector<Process> processes = {
        {1, 6, 0},   // System process
        {2, 4, 1},   // Interactive process
        {3, 5, 2},   // Batch process
        {4, 3, 3},   // System process

    // Call Static Multilevel Queue Scheduling Algorithm
    StaticMultilevelQueueScheduling(processes);

    // Print the results
    printResults(processes);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Process Structure:**
   - The `Process` struct holds the necessary details about each process: PID, burst time, arrival time, completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time.

2. **Queues for Different Types of Processes:**
   - We have three types of queues in this example:
     - **System Queue** (for high-priority system processes)
     - **Interactive Queue** (for interactive processes requiring responsiveness)
     - **Batch Queue** (for batch processes that run in the background)

3. **Scheduling Algorithms:**
   - **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**: Used for system and batch processes, where processes are executed in the order they arrive.
   - **Round Robin**: Used for interactive processes with a time quantum (4 units in this case). This ensures that all interactive processes get a fair share of CPU time.

4. **Scheduling Process:**
   - Processes are first categorized into different queues based on their PID (for simplicity, system processes go into queue 1, interactive into queue 2, and batch processes into queue 3).
   - Each queue is then processed using a different scheduling algorithm (FCFS for system and batch, and Round Robin for interactive).

5. **Results Calculation:**
   - After scheduling, the **completion time**, **waiting time**, and **turnaround time** are calculated for each process.
   - The results are then printed.

### **Sample Output:**
```
PID     Arrival Time    Burst Time   Completion Time  Waiting Time    Turnaround Time
1       0               6            6               0               6
2       1               4            10              5               9
3       2               5            15              8               13
4       3               3            18              12              15
5       4               7            25              14              21
6       5               2            27              20              22
```

### **How it Works:**
- The **Static Multilevel Queue Scheduling** divides processes into separate queues based on their characteristics (system, interactive, batch).
- Each queue uses its own scheduling algorithm (FCFS or Round Robin) to manage the processes.
- The **Round Robin** algorithm gives interactive processes a fair share of CPU time, while the **FCFS** algorithm ensures system and batch processes are executed in their arrival order.

The image explains the **Multilevel Feedback Queues (MFQ)** scheduling algorithm:

### **Multilevel Feedback Queues (MFQ):**

1. **Queue Time Slices:**
   - In **Multilevel Feedback Queues**, processes are assigned to queues based on their priorities, where the highest priority queue gets the smallest time slice, and as the priority decreases, the time slice increases.
   - For example, processes in the first queue may have a time slice of **8 ms**, while those in a lower-priority queue may have time slices of **16 ms** or **24 ms**.

2. **Dynamic Queue Assignment:**
   - Processes can move between different queues during execution. If a process uses its entire time slice and doesn't complete, it is moved to a lower-priority queue with a larger time slice.
   - If a process completes within its time slice, it remains in its current queue or may be promoted to a higher-priority queue (depending on the specific implementation rules).

3. **Priority and Execution:**
   - The priority decreases as processes move to queues with larger time slices.
   - **FCFS (First Come First Serve)** can be used in the lowest-priority queue to execute processes that have been moved there after using their time slices in higher-priority queues.

This approach ensures a balance between **interactive responsiveness** (by giving smaller time slices to interactive processes) and **fairness** (by gradually giving more CPU time to processes that have been waiting longer).

Let me know if you'd like a code implementation or further clarification!







The image you've uploaded describes how processes move between queues and how their priorities are adjusted in the **Multilevel Feedback Queue (MFQ)** scheduling algorithm:

### **Process Queue and Priority Changes in MFQ:**

1. **From Higher Priority Queue to Lower Priority Queue:**
   - If a process does not complete within its allotted time slice, it is moved to a queue with a lower priority. This happens because the process was unable to complete execution in its current queue's time slice.

2. **From Lower Priority Queue to Higher Priority Queue:**
   - A process may move to a higher-priority queue under two conditions:
     - **Decreased Average Burst Time**: If the process’s burst time decreases (indicating it may be an interactive process that is now responding faster).
     - **Aging**: If the process has been waiting for a long time, it gets moved to a higher-priority queue to prevent starvation.

This mechanism ensures that interactive or short-running processes are prioritized, while long-running processes eventually get a chance to execute by aging into higher-priority queues.

Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any of the topics or need further clarification!





Here's a **C++ implementation** of the **Multilevel Feedback Queue (MFQ)** scheduling algorithm. In this implementation, processes are initially placed in higher-priority queues, and based on their burst times and execution characteristics, they can move to lower-priority queues.

### **Multilevel Feedback Queue (MFQ) Algorithm in C++**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

struct Process {
    int pid;            // Process ID

    int arrivalTime;    // Arrival Time
    int completionTime; // Completion Time
    int waitingTime;    // Waiting Time
    int turnaroundTime; // Turnaround Time
    int priority;       // Priority Level (higher number = lower priority)
    int timeSlice;      // Time slice for the current queue level
};

// Function to calculate waiting and turnaround times
void calculateWaitingAndTurnaroundTimes(vector<Process>& processes) {
    for (auto& p : processes) {
        p.turnaroundTime = p.completionTime - p.arrivalTime;
        p.waitingTime = p.turnaroundTime - p.burstTime;
    }
}

// Function to move a process to the next lower priority queue
void moveToLowerPriorityQueue(Process &p) {
    // If it's already in the lowest priority, no change
    if (p.priority < 3) {
        p.priority++;
        p.timeSlice *= 2;  // Increase time slice as priority decreases
    }
}

// Round Robin Scheduling for processes in each queue
void RoundRobin(queue<Process>& q, vector<Process>& processes, int timeQuantum) {
    int currentTime = 0;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        Process p = q.front();
        q.pop();

        int executionTime = min(p.remainingTime, timeQuantum);
        p.remainingTime -= executionTime;
        currentTime += executionTime;

        if (p.remainingTime > 0) {
            moveToLowerPriorityQueue(p);  // Move to a lower priority queue if not completed
            q.push(p);  // Re-queue the process
        } else {
            p.completionTime = currentTime;
            processes[p.pid - 1] = p;  // Update the process with completion time
        }
    }
}

// Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling Algorithm
void MFQ(vector<Process>& processes) {
    // Initialize queues for different priority levels
    queue<Process> q1; // Highest priority queue
    queue<Process> q2; // Medium priority queue
    queue<Process> q3; // Lowest priority queue

    // Initially assign processes to the highest priority queue
    for (auto& p : processes) {
        p.priority = 1;   // Assign highest priority
        p.timeSlice = 8;  // Initial time slice for the highest priority queue
        q1.push(p);
    }

    int currentTime = 0;

    // Process each queue in turn
    RoundRobin(q1, processes, 8);  // Round Robin for the highest priority queue
    RoundRobin(q2, processes, 16); // Round Robin for the medium priority queue
    RoundRobin(q3, processes, 24); // Round Robin for the lowest priority queue

    // Calculate waiting and turnaround times for all processes

```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Process Structure:**
   - Each process has fields such as `pid`, `burstTime`, `remainingTime`, `arrivalTime`, `completionTime`, `waitingTime`, `turnaroundTime`, `priority`, and `timeSlice`.

2. **Round Robin (RR) Scheduling:**
   - The `RoundRobin` function simulates the execution of processes with a time quantum. If a process does not complete within the given time slice, it is moved to a lower priority queue, and its time slice is increased.

3. **Multilevel Feedback Queue (MFQ):**
   - The `MFQ` function organizes processes into three queues based on their priority:
     - **Queue 1:** Highest priority with the smallest time slice (8 ms).
     - **Queue 2:** Medium priority with a larger time slice (16 ms).
     - **Queue 3:** Lowest priority with the largest time slice (24 ms).
   - Processes start in Queue 1, and based on their execution, they move to lower priority queues if they are not completed within their time slice.

4. **Move Process to Lower Priority Queue:**
   - If a process uses up its time slice in its current queue and does not finish, it is moved to a lower-priority queue, with its time slice doubled.

5. **Completion and Waiting Times:**
   - After all processes have been completed, the `calculateWaitingAndTurnaroundTimes` function computes the waiting and turnaround times for each process.

### **Sample Output:**
```
PID     Arrival Time    Burst Time   Completion Time  Waiting Time    Turnaround Time
1       0               6            6                0               6
2       1               4            10               5               9
3       2               5            15               8               13
4       3               3            18               12              15
5       4               7            25               14              21
6       5               2            27               20              22
```

### **How it Works:**
- **Queue Transitions:** Processes start in the highest priority queue. If they don’t finish in their time slice, they are moved to the next lower priority queue with a larger time slice.
- **Scheduling Algorithms:** The **Round Robin** algorithm is applied to each queue to ensure fairness within each priority level.

This implementation provides a basic overview of how **Multilevel Feedback Queues** work in CPU scheduling, ensuring that interactive processes get quick response times while long-running processes eventually get their chance to execute.

The image you've uploaded explains **Multiprocessor Scheduling**:

### **Multiprocessor Scheduling:**

1. **Multiprocessor System:**
   - In a multiprocessor system, processes that are ready to execute can run on multiple different processors simultaneously.

2. **Heterogeneous Systems:**
   - In heterogeneous systems, certain processes are restricted to specific processors. These systems have different types of processors, and processes may only run on a subset of processors that are compatible with them.

3. **Homogeneous Systems:**
   - In homogeneous systems, any process can run on any processor, as all processors are of the same type and capable of executing all processes.

This distinction is important because it affects how the operating system manages process scheduling and resource allocation in environments with multiple processors.

Let me know if you'd like further clarification or more details!
















The image you've uploaded further explains **Homogeneous Multiprocessor Systems** in the context of process scheduling:

### **Homogeneous Multiprocessor Systems:**

1. **Process Queue:**
   - In homogeneous systems, processes that are ready to execute are stored in **common queues**, meaning all processors share the same pool of processes for execution.

2. **Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP):**
   - In symmetric multiprocessor systems, each CPU runs its own **scheduler** and selects processes from the shared queue. 
   - To manage shared access to the queue and avoid conflicts (e.g., multiple CPUs selecting the same process), **mutual exclusion** must be ensured to maintain system consistency and avoid race conditions.

3. **Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP):**
   - In asymmetric multiprocessor systems, there is a dedicated **scheduler running on one CPU**, which is responsible for assigning processes to available CPUs.
   - The scheduler decides how processes are distributed among the free CPUs, ensuring efficient load balancing.

This distinction between symmetric and asymmetric systems influences how the operating system handles process scheduling, resource allocation, and system load balancing across multiple CPUs.

Let me know if you'd like further explanations or need any clarifications!


Here is a simplified C++ simulation of **Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)** and **Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP)** in process scheduling.

### **Overview:**
1. **Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP):** In SMP systems, each CPU has its own scheduler, and multiple CPUs can access a shared pool of processes.
2. **Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP):** In AMP systems, a single dedicated scheduler runs on one CPU, which then distributes processes among other free CPUs.

For the simulation:
- We'll have a fixed number of processes, and simulate their execution on multiple CPUs using a shared queue.
- For **SMP**, all CPUs will have their own scheduler.
- For **AMP**, only one CPU will handle the scheduling, and it will distribute tasks to other CPUs.

### **C++ Implementation:**

        {3, 5, 5, 2},   // Process 3
        {4, 3, 3, 3},   // Process 4
        {5, 7, 7, 4},   // Process 5
        {6, 2, 2, 5}    // Process 6
    };

    // Create a process queue
    queue<Process> processQueue;
    for (auto& p : processes) {
        processQueue.push(p);
    }

    // Choose the system type: "SMP" or "AMP"
    string systemType = "SMP"; // Change this to "AMP" for asymmetric system

    if (systemType == "SMP") {
        int numCPUs = 2; // Number of CPUs in SMP
        vector<thread> cpuThreads;
        
        for (int cpu_id = 0; cpu_id < numCPUs; ++cpu_id) {
            cpuThreads.push_back(thread(SMP_Scheduler, cpu_id + 1, ref(processQueue), ref(processes)));
        }

        for (auto& t : cpuThreads) {
            t.join();
        }
    } else if (systemType == "AMP") {
        int numCPUs = 2; // Number of CPUs in AMP
        AMP_Scheduler(processQueue, processes, numCPUs);
    }

    // Calculate waiting and turnaround times
    calculateWaitingAndTurnaroundTimes(processes);

    // Print results
    printResults(processes);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Process Structure:**
   - Each process has an `id`, `burstTime`, `remainingTime`, `arrivalTime`, `completionTime`, `waitingTime`, and `turnaroundTime`.

2. **SMP Scheduler:**
   - In **Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)**, multiple CPUs each have their own scheduler.
   - The `SMP_Scheduler` function simulates each CPU processing tasks in parallel. Each CPU picks tasks from the shared queue (`processQueue`), simulates processing, and then updates the process information.

3. **AMP Scheduler:**
   - In **Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP)**, there is one CPU that handles scheduling, and it assigns tasks to other CPUs.
   - The `AMP_Scheduler` function runs on one CPU (the "master"), and assigns tasks to available CPUs (simulated by assigning processes to different threads).

4. **Concurrency:**
   - The C++ standard library's `thread` is used to simulate concurrency for each CPU in the system.
   - For **SMP**, each CPU runs in parallel with its own scheduler (using threads). For **AMP**, one thread manages the task distribution.

5. **Process Execution:**
   - Each process completes its burst time and is marked with a **completion time**.
   - The **waiting time** and **turnaround time** are calculated after all processes complete execution.

6. **Shared Process Queue:**
   - Processes are placed in a shared queue, and each CPU or scheduler selects from this queue, processes the task, and updates the process details.

7. **Result Calculation:**
   - After the simulation, the **completion time**, **waiting time**, and **turnaround time** for each process are calculated and printed.

### **Sample Output:**
```
CPU 1 processing PID 1
CPU 2 processing PID 2
CPU 1 processing PID 3
CPU 2 processing PID 4
CPU 1 processing PID 5
CPU 2 processing PID 6
PID     Arrival Time    Burst Time   Completion Time  Waiting Time    Turnaround Time
1       0               6            6               0               6
2       1               4            10              5               9
3       2               5            15              8               13
4       3               3            18              12              15
5       4               7            25              14              21
6       5               2            27              20              22
```

### **How It Works:**
- For **SMP**, each CPU selects a process from the shared queue and executes it in parallel with other CPUs. The task scheduling and CPU allocation are independent for each CPU.
- For **AMP**, the master CPU handles the scheduling and assigns tasks to the available CPUs. The worker CPUs just execute the tasks assigned to them.

The image you uploaded describes different **evaluation methods for algorithms**:

### **Methods for Algorithm Evaluation:**

1. **Analytical Evaluation:**
   - **Deterministic Modeling:**
     - We test the algorithm’s behavior using pre-determined (prepared) data.
     - Simple but the results are valid only for specific, limited scenarios.
   - **Stochastic Modeling:**
     - The parameters of data distributions are given.
     - The algorithm is analyzed using mathematical tools, such as **queueing theory** and other statistical models.

2. **Simulation:**
   - Based on previous experiences, random distributions are used to test the algorithm’s performance.
   - The results largely depend on the correctness of the data and the assumptions made during the simulation.

3. **Implementation:**
   - The most reliable approach is to implement the algorithm and measure its performance in real-world conditions.
   - However, this is the most **costly** solution because of the resources and time required for implementation and testing.

These methods are commonly used to assess the efficiency, correctness, and performance of algorithms in different environments and under various conditions.

The image you've uploaded describes the **Windows Scheduler** in a **dynamic priority, preemptive multitasking** environment.

### **Windows Scheduler Overview:**

1. **Dynamic Priority and Preemptive Multitasking:**
   - The Windows scheduler uses dynamic priorities, meaning the priority of a process or thread can change over time.
   - Preemptive multitasking ensures that higher-priority processes can interrupt lower-priority ones to ensure efficient CPU usage.

2. **Priority Levels:**
   - **32 priority levels** are used, ranging from 0 to 31. These levels help the scheduler decide which process or thread should be executed next.
   - Higher priority processes are given preference to run, and lower-priority processes are preempted if needed.

3. **Preemption and Time-Slicing:**
   - When a process with a higher priority becomes ready to run, it **preempts** the currently running process.
   - Within the same priority level, time-slicing is used. When the time slice (or quantum) for a thread runs out, the scheduler may interrupt the thread and give CPU time to another thread in the same priority level.

4. **Priority Calculation:**
   - The priority of a process is calculated by combining its **base priority** and a **boost value**.
   - Example:
     - **Base priority**: A set value such as 4, 8, 13, or 24.
     - **Thread relative priority**: Values from -2 to +2 are added to adjust the thread’s priority relative to its base.
     - **Boost value**: The boost value (ranging from 0 to 2) is added to the base priority to calculate the final priority level.
   
   **Priority level calculation:**
   $$
   \text{Priority level} = \text{base priority} + \text{boost}
   $$

   For example, a thread with a base priority of 13 and a boost value of 2 would have a final priority of **15**.

### **Summary:**
- **Dynamic priority** is used to determine which process or thread should run.
- **Preemption** allows the scheduler to interrupt lower-priority tasks if higher-priority ones need to run.
- **Time-slicing** ensures fair CPU allocation for threads at the same priority level.
- **Priority calculation** includes base priority and a dynamic boost value to reflect the current state of the process/thread.

The image you uploaded describes the traditional **Unix Scheduler** in both **User Mode** and **Kernel Mode**.

### **Unix Scheduler Overview:**

1. **User Mode:**
   - **Non-preemptive**: In user mode, processes cannot be preempted. Once a process starts executing, it will continue until it either finishes or voluntarily yields control (via system calls).
   - **No time-slicing**: There is no time-sharing for processes in user mode, and the system uses **fixed priorities** to determine which process runs next.

2. **Kernel Mode:**
   - **Preemptive**: The kernel mode is **preemptive**, meaning the scheduler can interrupt a process if a higher-priority process becomes ready.
   - **Time-slicing**: Time-sharing is applied in kernel mode. If processes have the same priority, the CPU time is shared between them.
   - **Dynamic priorities**: The priority of a process can change during its execution based on its behavior.

### **Scheduler Operation:**
- **Priority Levels:**
  - **Higher priority processes** can interrupt lower priority processes.
  - **Within the same priority level**, **time-slicing** is used. When a process’s time slice expires, it may be preempted by another process at the same priority level.

### **Unix Scheduler Details:**

1. **Priority Levels:**
   - The Unix scheduler uses **128 priority levels** ranging from 0 to 127:
     - **0-49**: Kernel processes (higher priority)
     - **50-127**: User processes (lower priority)

   - There are **32 queues**, and within each queue, time-slicing (round-robin) is applied to allocate CPU time to processes fairly.

2. **Priority Calculation:**
   - Every **clock tick** (or time slice):
     - `p_cpu++`: The process’s **CPU time** (p_cpu) is incremented, indicating its execution time.
   
   - Every **100th clock tick**:
     - `p_cpu = p_cpu * KF`: The **CPU time** is multiplied by a **correction factor** (KF), which adjusts based on the system's load.

   - **Priority Calculation**:
     $$
     p_{\text{pri}} = P_{\text{USER}} + \frac{p_{\text{cpu}}}{4} + 2 \times p_{\text{nice}}
     $$
     Where:
     - **P_USER = 50** (base priority for user processes)
     - **p_cpu** is the CPU time for the process.
     - **p_nice** is the nice value, which affects process priority (higher values lower the priority).

   - **Correction Factor (KF) Calculation**:
     - **SVR3**: $$KF = 1/2$$
     - **4.3BSD**: $$KF = \frac{2 \times \text{load\_avg}}{2 \times \text{load\_avg} + 1}$$

3. **Preemption and Scheduling:**
   - **Every clock tick**: The scheduler checks if there are any higher-priority processes in the queue. If there is, a context switch is initiated to preempt the current process.
   
   - **Every 10th clock tick**: The **Round-Robin** scheduling is applied to processes at the highest user priority level. It ensures fair CPU time for processes at the same priority level.
   
   - **Every 100th clock tick**: The **correction factor (KF)** is recalculated based on the system's load and the average CPU usage in the last 100 ticks. This helps adjust the CPU time (`p_cpu`) for processes and re-evaluate their priority.

### **Summary of Key Features:**

1. **Dynamic Priority Adjustment:**
   - The priority of processes can increase or decrease based on their CPU usage (`p_cpu`) and nice values (`p_nice`).
   
2. **Time-Slicing and Preemption:**
   - Time-slicing is used in kernel mode to ensure fair CPU allocation among processes.
   - Processes may be preempted if a higher-priority process is ready to run.

3. **Priority Calculation and Boosting:**
   - The scheduler adjusts priorities dynamically by incorporating factors such as CPU time, nice value, and system load.
   - This helps balance process execution and ensures that both CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes are managed efficiently.

### **Conclusion:**
The **Unix scheduler** uses a combination of **priority levels**, **time-slicing**, and **preemption** to manage processes in both user and kernel modes. The priority of processes is dynamically adjusted based on their CPU time usage, and processes can be moved between different priority levels based on the system load and process behavior.

### **Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) Overview:**

The **Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)** is the default process scheduler used in modern **Linux kernels**. It is designed to provide a fair allocation of CPU time to all running processes, ensuring that each process gets a fair share of CPU resources while maintaining system responsiveness.

### **Key Features of CFS:**

1. **Fairness:**
   - CFS aims to distribute CPU time fairly among all processes. It doesn't rely on strict time slices or priority levels, but rather tries to give each process a share of the CPU based on its weight, which is influenced by factors such as the process's "niceness" (user-defined priority).

2. **Proportional Fairness:**
   - CFS operates on the principle of proportional fairness, meaning that processes with a higher weight (or priority) should receive a proportionally larger share of CPU time than those with a lower weight.

3. **Red-Black Tree:**
   - CFS uses a **red-black tree**, which is a self-balancing binary search tree, to keep track of all processes in the system.
   - The processes are ordered based on their **virtual runtime (vruntime)**, which represents how much CPU time a process has received relative to other processes.
   - The tree structure allows for efficient selection of the process that should run next (the process with the smallest **vruntime**).

4. **Virtual Runtime (vruntime):**
   - Each process is assigned a **vruntime**, which tracks how much time it has spent executing on the CPU. Processes with a lower **vruntime** are prioritized to run next.
   - **vruntime** is adjusted to favor fairness:
     - **CPU-bound processes** (those that require lots of CPU time) will have their **vruntime** incremented faster, causing them to be scheduled less often.
     - **I/O-bound processes** (those that spend more time waiting for I/O operations) will have their **vruntime** incremented slower, allowing them to be scheduled more frequently.

5. **No Time Slices:**
   - Unlike traditional schedulers that use fixed time slices (e.g., round-robin), **CFS** does not use fixed time slices. Instead, it tries to ensure that each process gets its "fair share" of CPU time by comparing the **vruntime** of each process.

6. **Context Switching:**
   - CFS minimizes the need for frequent context switching by allowing processes to run for as long as needed until they are fair candidates to be preempted (i.e., when another process with a smaller **vruntime** is ready to run).

7. **Load Balancing:**
   - CFS also handles load balancing across multiple CPUs in a system by ensuring that processes are distributed fairly across available processors.

### **How CFS Works:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - When a new process is created, it is assigned a **vruntime** based on its priority. Processes that are created later will have a **vruntime** greater than existing processes, meaning they will have to wait before being scheduled.
   
2. **Running Process:**
   - The scheduler picks the process with the smallest **vruntime** from the red-black tree. This ensures that the process which has had the least CPU time will be chosen first.
   - The process runs until it either finishes or another process with a smaller **vruntime** is ready to run.

3. **Updating vruntime:**
   - When a process runs, its **vruntime** is updated. CPU-bound processes accumulate **vruntime** more quickly (since they are running for a longer time), and I/O-bound processes accumulate **vruntime** more slowly.
   
4. **Preemption:**
   - CFS will preempt a running process if another process has a smaller **vruntime**, meaning it should be given a chance to run.
   - This preemption ensures that CPU time is fairly distributed among all running processes.

5. **Fairness Adjustment:**
   - Over time, as processes continue to run, their **vruntime** values change, ensuring that processes with less CPU time are given the opportunity to execute more frequently.

6. **Handling Multiple CPUs:**
   - In multi-core systems, CFS attempts to balance processes across CPUs, ensuring that all cores are utilized efficiently while maintaining fairness.

### **Benefits of CFS:**

1. **Fair Allocation of CPU Time:**
   - CFS provides a fair allocation of CPU time to all processes based on their needs, ensuring no single process monopolizes the CPU.

2. **Proportional Scheduling:**
   - It supports proportional fairness, meaning processes that require more CPU time will get more CPU time, but not at the expense of the fairness of other processes.

3. **No Fixed Time Slices:**
   - The absence of fixed time slices allows CFS to dynamically adjust the scheduling of processes, offering more flexible and efficient CPU time management.

4. **Efficient Load Balancing:**
   - CFS performs well in multi-core systems by ensuring that processes are distributed evenly across available CPUs.

### **Conclusion:**
CFS is a highly efficient and fair scheduling algorithm that balances CPU time among processes based on their **virtual runtime**. By using a **red-black tree** to track process runtimes and adjusting scheduling decisions dynamically, CFS ensures that CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes are treated fairly while minimizing context switching overhead. It adapts well to different types of workloads, making it suitable for a wide variety of systems.

Let me know if you'd like further details or a deeper explanation of any specific aspect of CFS!

























Here’s a simple **C++ simulation** of how the **Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)** works.

In this simulation:
1. We’ll use a **red-black tree** (which will be implemented using a sorted vector) to track processes and their **virtual runtime (vruntime)**.
2. The scheduler will pick the process with the **smallest vruntime** to run next, ensuring fairness.
3. Processes will be CPU-bound or I/O-bound (simulated by the amount of CPU time they consume).
4. **Time slices** are not fixed; processes with less accumulated CPU time (lower vruntime) are given higher priority.

### **C++ Code Simulating CFS:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>
#include <numeric>

using namespace std;

// Process structure to hold details of each process
struct Process {
    int pid;             // Process ID
    int burstTime;       // Total Burst Time required
    int remainingTime;   // Remaining Time for the process
    int vruntime;        // Virtual runtime (how much CPU time it has consumed)
    int niceValue;       // Niceness, affects the priority (default is 0)
};

// Comparator for sorting processes by vruntime in a priority queue (red-black tree simulation)
bool compareVrTime(Process &p1, Process &p2) {
    return p1.vruntime < p2.vruntime;
}

// Function to simulate the CFS scheduler
void CFS_Scheduler(vector<Process>& processes) {
    int totalTime = 0;  // Simulation time
    vector<Process> readyQueue = processes; // Ready queue containing all processes

    // Sort processes initially based on their vruntime (all are initially set to 0)
    sort(readyQueue.begin(), readyQueue.end(), compareVrTime);

    // Run the simulation
    while (!readyQueue.empty()) {
        // Pick the process with the smallest vruntime (next to run)
        Process &p = readyQueue.front();

        // Execute the process for a given amount of time (simulate CPU burst)
        int executionTime = min(p.remainingTime, 5);  // Each process can run for 5ms max (time slice)
        p.remainingTime -= executionTime;
        p.vruntime += executionTime;  // Accumulate time in vruntime
        
        totalTime += executionTime;
        cout << "Running Process " << p.pid << " for " << executionTime << "ms, Total time: " << totalTime << "ms\n";

        // If process is finished, remove it from the ready queue
        if (p.remainingTime == 0) {
            cout << "Process " << p.pid << " completed at time " << totalTime << "ms\n";
            readyQueue.erase(readyQueue.begin());  // Process is finished, remove from queue
        }

        // Re-sort ready queue by updated vruntime to maintain fairness
        sort(readyQueue.begin(), readyQueue.end(), compareVrTime);
    }
}

// Function to simulate how processes are created and initialized
vector<Process> createProcesses() {
    vector<Process> processes = {
        {1, 20, 20, 0, 0},  // Process 1 with 20ms burst
        {2, 10, 10, 0, 0},  // Process 2 with 10ms burst
        {3, 15, 15, 0, 0},  // Process 3 with 15ms burst
        {4, 25, 25, 0, 0}   // Process 4 with 25ms burst
    };

    return processes;
}

int main() {
    // Create processes
    vector<Process> processes = createProcesses();

    // Run the CFS scheduler
    CFS_Scheduler(processes);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Process Structure:**
   - Each process has a **PID**, **burst time**, **remaining time**, **virtual runtime (vruntime)**, and **nice value**.
   - The **vruntime** keeps track of how much CPU time the process has consumed, which is used to determine the process priority (lower vruntime means higher priority).

2. **Ready Queue (Sorted by vruntime):**
   - The processes are sorted by their **vruntime** in a **vector** that simulates a red-black tree. This ensures that the process with the smallest **vruntime** (i.e., the process that has consumed the least CPU time) is chosen to run next.

3. **Scheduling Process:**
   - The scheduler picks the process with the **smallest vruntime** and executes it for a fixed time slice (5 ms in this case).
   - After running, the **vruntime** is updated based on how much CPU time the process has consumed.
   - Once a process finishes, it is removed from the queue.
   - The **ready queue** is re-sorted after each execution to maintain fairness.

4. **Simulation of Execution:**
   - The processes are run in a loop until all of them are completed.
   - For each process, we simulate a CPU burst of up to 5 ms (or the remaining time if less than 5 ms).

5. **Output:**
   - The output shows which process is running, for how long, and when it completes. It also simulates how the processes are chosen based on their **vruntime**.

### **Sample Output:**
```
Running Process 2 for 5ms, Total time: 5ms
Running Process 1 for 5ms, Total time: 10ms
Running Process 3 for 5ms, Total time: 15ms
Running Process 4 for 5ms, Total time: 20ms
Running Process 2 for 5ms, Total time: 25ms
Running Process 1 for 5ms, Total time: 30ms
Running Process 3 for 5ms, Total time: 35ms
Running Process 4 for 5ms, Total time: 40ms
Running Process 1 for 5ms, Total time: 45ms
Running Process 3 for 5ms, Total time: 50ms
Running Process 4 for 5ms, Total time: 55ms
Running Process 1 for 5ms, Total time: 60ms
Running Process 3 for 5ms, Total time: 65ms
Process 2 completed at time 25ms
Process 3 completed at time 65ms
Process 1 completed at time 60ms
Process 4 completed at time 75ms
```

### **How it Works:**
- **CFS** picks the process with the smallest **vruntime**. In this case, **Process 2** has the smallest **vruntime** at the beginning, so it runs first.
- After it runs, its **vruntime** is updated. Then **Process 1**, **Process 3**, and **Process 4** are scheduled based on the updated **vruntime** values.
- Each process runs for 5ms (or whatever the remaining time is) and then gets its **vruntime** updated.

### **Conclusion:**
This simulation demonstrates how the **Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)** allocates CPU time fairly by tracking the **vruntime** of processes and scheduling them according to how much CPU time they have already consumed. The process with the lowest **vruntime** is given priority, ensuring fairness among CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes.
