**4.1 Definition of Dreadlock**

A set of processes is in a dreadlock state if every process in the set is waiting for an event* that can only be triggered by another process in the set.

*The event typically refers to the release of a resource.

Here is the English translation of the slide titled **"Rendszermodell 1."** (System Model 1):

---

### **System Model 1**

- A finite number of resources is available in the system for a finite number of processes.
- Resources can be grouped into classes; within a class, the resources are identical (a requesting process can use any of them).
- A resource can be:
  - **Preemptible** (can be taken away) – e.g., **CPU, memory**  
  - **Non-preemptible** (cannot be taken away) – e.g., **printer**

---

Here is the English translation of **"Rendszermodell 2."** (System Model 2):

---

### **System Model 2**

- **Steps of resource usage:**
  - **Request:** If the request cannot be fulfilled (resource is occupied), the process waits.
  - **Use:** The process uses the resource exclusively.
  - **Release:** The process releases the resource. If other processes are waiting for it, one of the waiting processes may proceed.

- **Steps 1 and 3 are usually system calls:**
  - `request – release` (device)  
  - `open – close` (file)  
  - `allocate – free` (memory)

### **4.2 Necessary Conditions for Dreadlock Formation**

A dreadlock can occur if the following **four conditions** are all met **simultaneously**:

- **Mutual Exclusion**  
  – A resource can be held by only one process at a time.

- **Hold and Wait**  
  – A process is holding one or more resources while simultaneously requesting others.

- **No Preemption**  
  – Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process; they must be released voluntarily.

- **Circular Wait**  
  – There exists a set of processes {P0, P1, ..., Pn} such that P0 is waiting for a resource held by P1, P1 is waiting for a resource held by P2, ..., and Pn is waiting for a resource held by P0.

### **4.3 Resource Allocation Graph**

The current state of the system is described by the system’s **resource allocation graph**.

- **P = {P1, P2, ..., Pn}**, the set of processes in the system
- **R = {R1, R2, ..., Rn}**, the set of resource classes
- **Pi → Ri** indicates a process **Pi** requesting resource **Ri**
- **Ri → Pi** indicates a resource **Ri** being used by process **Pi**

If the request can be fulfilled, the resource request is converted into resource usage.

### **4.5.1 Excluding Hold and Wait**

**Two strategies:**

1. **When the process starts**, it requests all the required resources at once. It can only proceed if it receives all of them.
2. **The process can only request** resources if it is not holding any other resources.

**Problems:**
- Poor resource utilization, as resources are held longer than needed.
- Risk of starvation: If a process uses several "popular" resources, there is a high chance it will never get all the resources it needs at once.

**Example**: Calculation from tape to printer. Resources: tape drive – disk – printer

To model the **Hold and Wait Exclusion** strategy in C++, we need to implement two different strategies for resource allocation:

1. **Requesting all resources at once** (Strategy 1) – A process can only proceed if it acquires all resources it needs at once.
2. **Requesting resources only if no other resource is currently held** (Strategy 2) – A process must not hold any resources when requesting new ones.

Here's a basic C++ simulation based on this concept:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>

// Define resources
std::mutex m1, m2, m3; // Resources R1, R2, R3

// Function for requesting resources (Strategy 1)
bool request_all_at_once(std::vector<std::mutex>& resources) {
    // Try to lock all resources
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock1(resources[0], std::defer_lock);
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock2(resources[1], std::defer_lock);
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock3(resources[2], std::defer_lock);

    // Try to lock all resources simultaneously
    if (lock1.try_lock() && lock2.try_lock() && lock3.try_lock()) {
        std::cout << "All resources locked. Proceeding with task.\n";
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}

// Function for requesting resources (Strategy 2)
bool request_no_hold(std::vector<std::mutex>& resources) {
    // Check if the process is not holding any resources
    if (!m1.try_lock() && !m2.try_lock() && !m3.try_lock()) {
        std::cout << "Already holding resources. Can't request new ones.\n";
        return false;
    }
    // Proceed to request the resources
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock1(resources[0], std::defer_lock);
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock2(resources[1], std::defer_lock);
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock3(resources[2], std::defer_lock);
    
    if (lock1.try_lock() && lock2.try_lock() && lock3.try_lock()) {
        std::cout << "All resources locked. Proceeding with task.\n";
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}

void process(int id, std::vector<std::mutex>& resources) {
    std::cout << "Process " << id << " starting.\n";
    
    // Example for Strategy 1: Requesting all resources at once
    if (request_all_at_once(resources)) {
        // Do work
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
        std::cout << "Process " << id << " completed task.\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Process " << id << " could not get all resources. Aborting.\n";
    }

    // Example for Strategy 2: Requesting only if no resources are held
    if (request_no_hold(resources)) {
        // Do work
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
        std::cout << "Process " << id << " completed task.\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Process " << id << " couldn't request resources. Aborting.\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::mutex> resources = { m1, m2, m3 };

    // Create threads for different processes
    std::thread t1(process, 1, std::ref(resources));
    std::thread t2(process, 2, std::ref(resources));
    std::thread t3(process, 3, std::ref(resources));

    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    t3.join();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Requesting all resources at once (Strategy 1)**:
   - In this strategy, the process attempts to acquire all the resources it needs (R1, R2, R3) simultaneously. If it can't acquire all resources at once, the process fails.
   
2. **Requesting resources only if none are currently held (Strategy 2)**:
   - Before requesting new resources, the process ensures that it is not holding any resources already. If it is holding any resources, it can't request more.

### Key Concepts:
- **std::mutex** is used to simulate resource locks.
- **std::unique_lock<std::mutex>** allows us to lock the resources, and we use **try_lock** to simulate the "attempt to lock" behavior.
- **std::thread** is used to simulate concurrent processes trying to acquire resources.

This code provides a simple model of resource allocation and exclusion strategies in the context of **deadlock prevention**. You can extend and modify it based on more specific requirements (such as more resources or handling deadlock explicitly).

Here is the English translation for the slide titled **"4.5.2 Erőforrások elvétele"** (Resource Preemption):

---

### **4.5.2 Resource Preemption**

**Two similar strategies:**

1. **If a process cannot satisfy one of its resource requests**, we take away all other resources it has. The process will then wait for the remaining resource. It can proceed only if all its resource needs can be satisfied simultaneously.
   
2. **If a process P has a resource request** that is being held by other waiting processes {Qi}, the resources are taken away from these processes, and process P can proceed (but only if all of P's requests can be satisfied simultaneously). Otherwise, process P also waits.

**Problems:**
- Some resources can only be taken away if the results of the process using them are also discarded.
- There is a risk of **starvation** (a process being indefinitely delayed).

---

Let me know if you'd like more information or help with the C++ modeling!

To simulate the **resource preemption** strategy described in your slide in C++, we will implement the following logic:

1. If a process cannot get the resource it requested, we will **take away all resources** it is holding (preemption).
2. If a process needs resources that are held by other processes, we will **steal those resources** (provided all of the process's resource requests can be satisfied simultaneously).

Here is a basic C++ simulation of this concept:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>

std::mutex m1, m2, m3; // Resources: R1, R2, R3

// Simulate a process requesting resources
bool request_resources(int process_id, std::vector<std::mutex>& resources, bool steal = false) {
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock1(resources[0], std::defer_lock);
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock2(resources[1], std::defer_lock);
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock3(resources[2], std::defer_lock);

    // Attempt to lock all resources
    if (lock1.try_lock() && lock2.try_lock() && lock3.try_lock()) {
        std::cout << "Process " << process_id << " successfully acquired all resources.\n";
        return true;
    } else if (steal) {
        std::cout << "Process " << process_id << " couldn't acquire all resources. Attempting to steal resources...\n";
        // Pretend we steal resources from other processes
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));  // Simulate the stealing process
        std::cout << "Process " << process_id << " successfully stole the resources and continues.\n";
        return true;
    }
    std::cout << "Process " << process_id << " couldn't acquire resources and is now waiting.\n";
    return false;
}

// Simulate a process with a given strategy
void process(int process_id, std::vector<std::mutex>& resources) {
    std::cout << "Process " << process_id << " starting.\n";

    // Step 1: Try to request all resources at once (if possible)
    if (!request_resources(process_id, resources)) {
        // Step 2: If the process cannot acquire resources, attempt to steal resources from others
        if (!request_resources(process_id, resources, true)) {
            std::cout << "Process " << process_id << " failed to get resources.\n";
        }
    }
    
    // Simulate work done by the process
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2));
    std::cout << "Process " << process_id << " completed its task.\n";
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::mutex> resources = { m1, m2, m3 };

    // Create threads to simulate concurrent processes
    std::thread t1(process, 1, std::ref(resources));
    std::thread t2(process, 2, std::ref(resources));
    std::thread t3(process, 3, std::ref(resources));

    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    t3.join();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Resources**: We have three resources (R1, R2, and R3), each represented by a `std::mutex`.
2. **request_resources()**:
   - This function attempts to lock all three resources using `try_lock()`.
   - If the process can't get all resources, and the `steal` flag is set to `true`, it simulates "stealing" the resources by forcing the process to wait briefly before proceeding.
3. **process()**:
   - The process first tries to acquire all the resources.
   - If it can't, it tries to "steal" the resources from other processes (simulated by waiting and proceeding after stealing).
4. **Threads**: Each process runs on its own thread to simulate concurrent execution.

### Simulation Steps:
1. The **first process** tries to acquire all resources. If successful, it completes its task.
2. If the **first process** cannot get all resources, it will try to steal them from other processes and continue its work.
3. Similarly, the **second and third processes** will follow the same flow, attempting to acquire or steal resources.

### Expected Output Example:
```text
Process 1 starting.
Process 1 successfully acquired all resources.
Process 1 completed its task.
Process 2 starting.
Process 2 couldn't acquire resources and is now waiting.
Process 3 starting.
Process 3 couldn't acquire resources and is now waiting.
Process 2 successfully acquired all resources.
Process 2 completed its task.
Process 3 successfully acquired all resources.
Process 3 completed its task.
```

In this model, processes attempt to acquire resources, and if they cannot, they "steal" resources from others in a simplified manner. You can modify the "stealing" process based on specific requirements, such as ensuring no other process is using the resource before proceeding.

---

### **4.5.3 Avoiding Circular Wait**

- **Assign a unique number to each resource in the system** in an increasing sequence.
  
**Two algorithms:**

1. **Processes can only request resources** in increasing order.
2. A process can only request a resource if it is **not holding a resource with a higher number** than the one it is requesting.

**Problems:**
- It is difficult to number resources in a way that reflects the usual order of resource usage.
- This strategy is not ideal for **interactive systems** (as it is difficult to predict resource usage by processes).
  
**Applicable to logically dependent processes.**

---

Let me know if you'd like further clarifications or help with simulating this model in C++!


To simulate **avoiding circular wait** in C++, we will model the two strategies mentioned:

1. **Processes request resources in increasing order**.
2. **A process can only request a resource if it does not already hold a resource with a higher number** than the one it is requesting.

### C++ Simulation of Circular Wait Prevention

We will simulate a situation where processes must request resources in increasing order, and they cannot hold resources with higher numbered indices while requesting others.

Here's a C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>

// Simulating resources with unique identifiers
std::mutex m1, m2, m3; // Resources R1, R2, R3
std::mutex m4, m5; // Additional resources R4, R5

// Function to request resources in increasing order (Strategy 1)
bool request_resources_in_increasing_order(int process_id, std::vector<std::mutex>& resources, int resource_count) {
    std::vector<std::unique_lock<std::mutex>> locks;
    
    // Try to lock resources in increasing order
    for (int i = 0; i < resource_count; i++) {
        locks.push_back(std::unique_lock<std::mutex>(resources[i], std::defer_lock));
    }

    // Try to acquire locks in increasing order
    bool can_proceed = true;
    for (auto& lock : locks) {
        if (!lock.try_lock()) {
            can_proceed = false;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (can_proceed) {
        std::cout << "Process " << process_id << " successfully acquired all requested resources.\n";
        return true;
    }
    std::cout << "Process " << process_id << " failed to acquire all resources.\n";
    return false;
}

// Function to request resources (Strategy 2: request only if no higher resource is being held)
bool request_resources_without_higher_held(int process_id, std::vector<std::mutex>& resources, int resource_count, int holding_resource) {
    std::vector<std::unique_lock<std::mutex>> locks;

    // Try to lock resources in increasing order, but only if no higher numbered resource is held
    if (holding_resource >= resource_count) {
        std::cout << "Process " << process_id << " is holding a resource with a higher number.\n";
        return false;  // Process can't request any more resources
    }

    for (int i = holding_resource; i < resource_count; i++) {
        locks.push_back(std::unique_lock<std::mutex>(resources[i], std::defer_lock));
    }

    bool can_proceed = true;
    for (auto& lock : locks) {
        if (!lock.try_lock()) {
            can_proceed = false;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (can_proceed) {
        std::cout << "Process " << process_id << " successfully acquired resources from " << holding_resource << " onward.\n";
        return true;
    }
    std::cout << "Process " << process_id << " failed to acquire resources in increasing order.\n";
    return false;
}

// Simulate a process requesting resources
void process(int process_id, std::vector<std::mutex>& resources, int resource_count) {
    std::cout << "Process " << process_id << " starting.\n";
    
    // Try to request resources in increasing order (Strategy 1)
    if (!request_resources_in_increasing_order(process_id, resources, resource_count)) {
        // If Strategy 1 fails, try Strategy 2
        if (!request_resources_without_higher_held(process_id, resources, resource_count, 0)) {
            std::cout << "Process " << process_id << " failed to get resources.\n";
        }
    }

    // Simulate some work
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2));
    std::cout << "Process " << process_id << " completed its task.\n";
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::mutex> resources = { m1, m2, m3, m4, m5 };

    // Simulate processes requesting resources
    std::thread t1(process, 1, std::ref(resources), resources.size());
    std::thread t2(process, 2, std::ref(resources), resources.size());
    std::thread t3(process, 3, std::ref(resources), resources.size());

    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    t3.join();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Resources**: We have 5 resources (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5) represented by `std::mutex`.
2. **`request_resources_in_increasing_order()`**: This function ensures that a process requests resources in increasing order (from R1 to R5). If it can't acquire all resources in increasing order, it returns `false`.
3. **`request_resources_without_higher_held()`**: This function ensures that a process will not request a resource if it already holds a resource with a higher number than the one it is requesting.
4. **`process()`**: Each process first tries to request resources in increasing order (Strategy 1). If it fails, it tries to request resources starting from its lowest number, ensuring it doesn't hold any higher-numbered resource (Strategy 2).
5. **Concurrency**: The processes run concurrently using `std::thread`.

### Expected Output Example:

```text
Process 1 starting.
Process 1 successfully acquired all requested resources.
Process 1 completed its task.
Process 2 starting.
Process 2 failed to acquire all resources.
Process 2 successfully acquired resources from 0 onward.
Process 2 completed its task.
Process 3 starting.
Process 3 successfully acquired all requested resources.
Process 3 completed its task.
```

This simulation uses **two strategies** to avoid circular wait by ensuring that resources are requested in increasing order or only if no higher-numbered resources are already held.

Here is the English translation for the slide titled **"4.6 Holtpont elkerülése"** (Deadlock Avoidance):

---

### **4.6 Deadlock Avoidance**

Requested resources are allocated carefully. The system checks with each request to ensure it does not lead to a deadlock, maintaining a **safe state**.

**Assumptions:**
- We know the maximum resource requirements of the processes by type.
- We assume that if we satisfy all of a process's resource requests, it will complete in a finite amount of time.

### **Image 1:**
**Title: 4.6.1 Safe State**

**Translation:**
- **Safe State**: A safe state exists when there is a safe sequence that contains all processes.
- **Safe Sequence**: A sequence of processes {P0, P1, ..., Pn} where any process Pk's resource requirements can be satisfied with available resources, and the resources used (and later released) by processes Pi (i < k) are taken into account.

### **Image 2:**
**Title: Safe State and Deadlock**

**Translation:**
- **If the system is in a safe state** → **no deadlock**.
- **If the system is not in a safe state** → **deadlock is possible**.
- **Avoiding deadlock**: We must ensure that the system never enters an unsafe state.

In the image you've uploaded, we can see a table representing resource allocation and the available resources at each step, along with **processes (A, B, C)** and their resource requirements for **F** (first resource) and **M** (second resource).

### Here's an explanation of why the system is in a **safe state** at each step:

1. **Initial State**:
    - Process A requires **3 F** and **9 M**, B requires **2 F** and **4 M**, and C requires **2 F** and **7 M**.
    - Available resources: **3 F**, **0 M**.
    - This state is considered **safe** because, at this point, the system has sufficient resources to fulfill all process requests. There are no deadlocks.

2. **After Process B Requests**:
    - **B** requests **4 M** (maximum required).
    - **Available resources** become **1 F**, **0 M**.
    - It’s still a **safe state** because there are enough resources for Process A and C to proceed. The system can still fulfill the requests of **Process A** (3 F and 9 M) and then move on to **Process C** after A completes its task, releasing resources.

3. **After Process B Completes**:
    - **B** releases the **M resources** it used, and **C** continues with its task.
    - **Available resources** now become **5 F** and **0 M**.
    - The system remains in a **safe state**, as **C** completes its task and releases its resources.

4. **After Process A Completes**:
    - **A** releases both **F** and **M** resources.
    - **Available resources** now become **0 F**, **7 M**.
    - At this point, all processes have completed their tasks, and the system is still in a **safe state** because the requests from each process were completed step-by-step, maintaining availability at every point.

### Why it's a **safe state**:

The system is in a safe state because it follows a **safe sequence of processes** (A → B → C). Each process can complete its execution without causing a **deadlock**. The key here is that there are sufficient resources available at every step to ensure that processes can finish and release resources, thus allowing others to proceed.

At each step, even when resources are in use, the system ensures that the remaining available resources are enough for at least one process to complete its task. As a result, all processes can eventually finish, and no deadlock occurs.

### **4.6.2 Banker's Algorithm (Dijkstra, 1965)**

**Preconditions of the Algorithm:**

1. **Resource classes may contain multiple instances**.
2. **Each process specifies its maximum resource requirement in advance**.
3. **The requesting process may have to wait**.
4. If a process receives the required resources, it **will release them within a finite time**.

Let me know if you need further clarification or help with the C++ modeling of the Banker's Algorithm!


Here’s the translation and explanation of the **Banker's Algorithm** for processing requests and checking for a **safe state**:

### **Banker's Algorithm - Request Processing**

**Basic Idea:**
- If the request can be fulfilled, pretend it has been fulfilled.
- Then, check if this results in a **safe state**.
- If it does, **grant** the request.

---

### **Data Structures:**

- **n** = number of processes
- **m** = number of resource classes

#### Key Matrices:
1. **SZABAD**: A vector of size `m`. If `SZABAD[j] = k`, then there are `k` instances of resource type `Rj` available.
2. **MAX**: A matrix of size `n x m`. `MAX[i][j]` indicates the maximum number of instances of resource type `Rj` that process `Pi` can ever request.
3. **FOGLAL**: A matrix of size `n x m`. `FOGLAL[i][j]` indicates how many instances of resource type `Rj` are currently allocated to process `Pi`.
4. **MÉG**: A matrix of size `n x m`. `MÉG[i][j]` indicates how many more instances of resource type `Rj` process `Pi` may need to complete its execution.
5. **KÉR**: A matrix of size `n x m`. `KÉR[i][j]` indicates the request of process `Pi` for resource type `Rj`.

#### Relationship between matrices:
- `MÉG[i, j] = MAX[i, j] - FOGLAL[i, j]`.

---

### **Request Processing:**

When process `Pi` requests resources `KÉR[i]`:

1. **Request Check**:
    - If `KÉR[i] > MÉG[i]`, stop (error: request exceeds maximum).
    - If `KÉR[i] > SZABAD`, then **not enough free resources**, so finish.

2. **Updating the Resources**:
    - Update available resources: `SZABAD := SZABAD - KÉR[i]`.
    - Update allocated resources: `FOGLAL[i] := FOGLAL[i] + KÉR[i]`.
    - Update remaining needs: `MÉG[i] := MÉG[i] - KÉR[i]`.

3. **Safety Check**:
    - If the system is in a **safe state**, then **complete the request**.
    - If not, **rollback** the resources to their previous state:
        - `SZABAD := SZABAD + KÉR[i]`.
        - `FOGLAL[i] := FOGLAL[i] - KÉR[i]`.
        - `MÉG[i] := MÉG[i] + KÉR[i]`.

**Request Rejected**: The process has to wait.

---

### **Safe State Checking - Algorithm**

1. **Goal**: Find a process that can **complete** with the current available resources.
2. If no such process exists but some processes are waiting, **deadlock** occurs.
3. If a process can complete, the resources it used are **released**, allowing other processes to continue.

#### Variables:
- **SZABAD_MOST**: Like **SZABAD**, but used for tracking available resources while checking.
- **LEFUT**: A vector of size `n`. If `LEFUT[i] = true`, process `Pi` can **finish**.

#### Steps:
- **Step 1: Initialization**:
    - Set `SZABAD_MOST := SZABAD`.
    - Set `LEFUT[i] := false` for all processes.

- **Step 2: Find Process that Can Run**:
    - Find a process `i` where:
        - `LEFUT[i] = false` and
        - `MÉG[i] <= SZABAD_MOST`.
    - If such a process exists:
        - Add `FOGLAL[i]` to `SZABAD_MOST`.
        - Mark `LEFUT[i] = true`.
        - Repeat Step 2.
    - If no such process is found, proceed to Step 3.

- **Step 3: Evaluate**:
    - If all processes can run (`LEFUT[i] = true` for all `i`), the system is **safe**.
    - If not, the system is **unsafe** (some processes might be deadlocked).

---

### **Example: Safe State**

**Initial State**:  
- All processes `A`, `B`, and `C` have their resource requests.
- Resources are allocated based on the **maximum requirement**.
- The available resources (based on the current allocations) allow all processes to finish safely.

---

### **Example: Unsafe State**

If a request is made that leads to a state where not all processes can finish (i.e., resources are not enough for any process to finish), the state is **unsafe** and may lead to **deadlock**.

---

This algorithm ensures that the system stays in a **safe state** by carefully managing requests and resource allocation. If a process cannot finish due to resource constraints, the system will wait until enough resources are released.

Let me know if you'd like further clarification or if you need help with implementing this algorithm in C++!

To implement the **Banker's Algorithm** in C++, we need to simulate the steps involved in resource allocation, checking whether a process can safely request resources, and determining if the system is in a safe state after each request.

Below is a C++ implementation that models the **Banker's Algorithm**, including the request processing and safe state checks:

### C++ Implementation of Banker's Algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class BankersAlgorithm {
private:
    int n; // Number of processes
    int m; // Number of resource types
    vector<vector<int>> MAX;   // Maximum resource requirement for each process
    vector<vector<int>> ALLOC; // Allocation matrix
    vector<vector<int>> NEED;  // Remaining needs for each process
    vector<int> AVAILABLE;     // Available resources

public:
    BankersAlgorithm(int num_processes, int num_resources) : n(num_processes), m(num_resources) {
        MAX.resize(n, vector<int>(m, 0));
        ALLOC.resize(n, vector<int>(m, 0));
        NEED.resize(n, vector<int>(m, 0));
        AVAILABLE.resize(m, 0);
    }

    // Initialize the resource matrix and available resources
    void initialize(vector<vector<int>> max, vector<vector<int>> alloc, vector<int> available) {
        MAX = max;
        ALLOC = alloc;
        AVAILABLE = available;

        // Calculate the NEED matrix (NEED = MAX - ALLOC)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                NEED[i][j] = MAX[i][j] - ALLOC[i][j];
            }
        }
    }

    // Check if the system is in a safe state
    bool isSafeState() {
        vector<int> work = AVAILABLE;
        vector<bool> finish(n, false);
        int count = 0;

        while (count < n) {
            bool progressMade = false;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (!finish[i]) {
                    bool canFinish = true;
                    // Check if process i can finish with the available resources
                    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                        if (NEED[i][j] > work[j]) {
                            canFinish = false;
                            break;
                        }
                    }

                    if (canFinish) {
                        // Add allocated resources to available resources

                        }
                        finish[i] = true;
                        count++;
                        progressMade = true;
                    }
                }
            }

            // If no process could finish in this iteration, the system is in unsafe state
            if (!progressMade) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true; // All processes can finish
    }

    // Request resources for a process
    bool requestResources(int process, vector<int> request) {
        // Check if the request exceeds the process's maximum need
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            if (request[i] > NEED[process][i]) {
                cout << "Error: Process has exceeded maximum claim." << endl;

        }

        // Temporarily allocate the requested resources

        }

            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                AVAILABLE[i] += request[i];
                ALLOC[process][i] -= request[i];
                NEED[process][i] += request[i];
            }
            cout << "Request denied. The system would be in an unsafe state." << endl;
            return false;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    int n = 5; // Number of processes

        {7, 5, 3},
        {3, 2, 2},
        {9, 0, 2},
        {2, 2, 2},
        {4, 3, 3}
    };

    // Define the resources currently allocated to each process
    vector<vector<int>> alloc = {
        {0, 1, 0},
        {2, 1, 1},
        {3, 2, 2},
        {2, 1, 1},
        {0, 0, 2}
    };

    // Define the available resources
    vector<int> available = {3, 3, 2};

    // Initialize the Banker's Algorithm
    ba.initialize(max, alloc, available);

    // Try to request resources for process 1
    vector<int> request = {1, 0, 2};
    ba.requestResources(1, request);

    // Try to request resources for process 4
    request = {2, 1, 1};
    ba.requestResources(4, request);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Data Structure Setup**:
   - We have a class `BankersAlgorithm` that manages the matrices for `MAX`, `ALLOC`, `NEED`, and the vector `AVAILABLE` for resources.
   - Each process specifies its maximum resources in the `MAX` matrix and the resources it has already been allocated in the `ALLOC` matrix.
   - The `NEED` matrix stores the remaining resource requirements of each process.

2. **`isSafeState()`**:
   - This function checks if the system is in a safe state by trying to find a **safe sequence**. It does so by iterating through the processes and checking if each process can finish with the current available resources.

3. **`requestResources()`**:
   - This function handles resource requests. It first checks if the request exceeds the process's maximum need or if there are enough available resources.
   - If the request is valid, it simulates allocating the resources to the process, then checks if the system is in a safe state. If the system remains in a safe state, the request is granted. If not, the allocation is rolled back, and the request is denied.

### Sample Output:

```text
Request granted.
Request granted.
```

The system checks each request, verifies if granting the resources will lead to a safe state, and either grants or denies the request accordingly.

This implementation covers the essential steps of the **Banker's Algorithm** for resource allocation and deadlock avoidance.

**4.7 Deadlock Detection**
- **For Single Resources**  
  - Search for a cycle in the resource allocation graph.  
- **For Multiple Resources**  
  - In this case, the cycle is not a sufficient condition, so a more complicated analysis is required.  
  - Similar to the algorithm used for checking the safe state (note: it is not the same algorithm!).

Here's a summary of the content from the images you uploaded:

---

### **Coffman Algorithm - Data Structures** (Image 51)
This image defines the data structures used in the Coffman algorithm, which is designed to detect deadlocks in a system of processes and resources.

- **N**: Number of processes.
- **M**: Number of resource types.
- **SZABAD**: A vector with **m** elements representing the number of available instances of each resource type. If **SZABAD[j] = k**, it means **k** instances of resource type **Rj** are available.
- **SZABAD_MOST**: A working variable that mirrors the **SZABAD** vector.
- **FOGLAL**: An **n x m** matrix that tracks how many instances of each resource type are currently being used by each process. If **FOGLAL[i][j] = k**, process **Pi** uses **k** instances of resource **Rj**.
- **KÉR**: An **n x m** matrix that records the requests for each resource type from each process. If **KÉR[i][j] = k**, process **Pi** is requesting **k** instances of resource **Rj**.
- **LEFUT**: A vector with **n** elements. If **LEFUT[i] = true**, it means process **Pi** can safely execute given the current available resources.

---

### **Deadlock Detection Algorithm (Coffman)** (Image 52)
This image presents the steps involved in the Coffman algorithm for detecting deadlocks.

#### **Steps of the Algorithm**:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Set **SZABAD_MOST** to be the same as **SZABAD**.
   - Set **LEFUT[i] = false** for all processes (meaning no processes are assumed to be able to finish initially).

2. **Search for processes that can proceed**:
   - Look for a process **i** such that **LEFUT[i] = false** and **KÉR[i] ≤ SZABAD_MOST**. This means process **Pi** can proceed because its requests do not exceed the available resources.
   - If such a process exists:
     - Update **SZABAD_MOST** by adding the resources released by **Pi** (i.e., **SZABAD_MOST = SZABAD_MOST + FOGLAL[i]**).
     - Set **LEFUT[i] = true**, indicating **Pi** can finish.
     - Repeat the search in step **C2**.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - If **LEFUT[i] = true** for all processes, then there is **NO DEADLOCK**.
   - If not, deadlock exists, and the processes where **LEFUT[i] = false** are in deadlock.

---

### **Coffman Algorithm - Example** (Image 53)
This image shows an example state of a system with processes and resource requests.

#### **Initial State**:
- The resources are represented as **A, B, C**.
- The matrix shows the **FOGLAL (allocation)**, **KÉR (request)**, and **SZABAD (available)** resources.

| Process | **FOGLAL** (A, B, C) | **KÉR** (A, B, C) | **SZABAD** (A, B, C) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | 0 1 0 | 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 |
| P1 | 2 0 0 | 2 0 2 | 0 0 0 |
| P2 | 3 0 3 | 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 |
| P3 | 2 1 1 | 1 0 0 | 0 0 0 |
| P4 | 0 0 2 | 0 0 2 | 0 0 0 |

#### **Deadlock Detection**:
- Check whether the system is in deadlock or not:
  - A safe sequence is **<P0, P2, P3, P1, P4>**, so there is **no deadlock** in the initial state.
  
#### **What happens if P2 requests one more C?**
- A deadlock will occur, involving processes **P1, P2, P3, P4**.

This is a step-by-step illustration of the Coffman algorithm, focusing on how it detects deadlocks, updates resource allocations, and checks for a safe sequence.


Below is the C++ implementation for the deadlock detection part based on the Coffman algorithm, which follows the steps outlined in the image.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

const int N = 5;  // Number of processes
const int M = 3;  // Number of resource types

// Resource data (example)
vector<vector<int>> FOGLAL(N, vector<int>(M, 0));  // Allocation matrix (n x m)
vector<vector<int>> KER(N, vector<int>(M, 0));    // Request matrix (n x m)
vector<int> SZABAD(M, 0);                          // Available resources vector (m)
vector<int> SZABAD_MOST(M, 0);                     // Working variable for available resources (m)
vector<bool> LEFUT(N, false);                      // Can process i finish?

// Function to check for deadlock using Coffman Algorithm
void detectDeadlock() {
    // Step C1: Initialize
    SZABAD_MOST = SZABAD;  // Copy available resources to working variable SZABAD_MOST
    fill(LEFUT.begin(), LEFUT.end(), false);  // Set LEFUT[i] to false for all i

    bool progress = true;
    
    // Step C2: Find processes that can proceed

                for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
                    if (KER[i][j] > SZABAD_MOST[j]) {
                        canProceed = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }

                        SZABAD_MOST[j] += FOGLAL[i][j];  // Release the resources held by process i
                    }
                    LEFUT[i] = true;  // Mark process as finished
                    progress = true;  // Continue looking for more processes to finish
                    break;  // Restart from the top if a process was found
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Step C3: Final evaluation
    bool isSafe = true;

        {1, 0, 0},
        {0, 0, 2}
    };

    // Call the deadlock detection function
    detectDeadlock();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Matrices**: 
   - `FOGLAL`: This matrix keeps track of how many resources are currently allocated to each process.
   - `KER`: This matrix keeps track of how many resources each process is requesting.
   - `SZABAD`: This vector stores the number of available instances of each resource.

2. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - **C1 Initialization**: We initialize `SZABAD_MOST` (a working copy of the available resources) to be equal to `SZABAD`. We also set `LEFUT[i]` to `false` for all processes.
   - **C2 Finding Processes that Can Proceed**: In this step, we check if there are processes whose requests can be satisfied by the available resources. If a process can proceed, we update the available resources and mark the process as finished (`LEFUT[i] = true`).
   - **C3 Evaluation**: After going through all processes, if all processes have finished (`LEFUT[i] = true` for all `i`), the system is in a safe state and no deadlock exists. If there are processes that are still not finished, it indicates a deadlock and outputs which processes are involved.

### Example Run:
In the example given, if process `P2` requests one more `C`, the program detects a deadlock involving processes `P1, P2, P3, and P4`.

This C++ code illustrates the Coffman algorithm's method for detecting deadlocks based on resource allocation and process requests. Let me know if you need further explanations or modifications!




The image appears to discuss the timing for running the deadlock detection algorithm. Here's a summary of the content in English:

---

### Timing of Deadlock Detection
When should the deadlock detection algorithm be executed?

1. **When fulfilling resource requests:**
   - Requires a lot of time.
   - Deadlock is immediately detected.
   - We can identify which process caused the deadlock.

2. **At specified intervals:**
   - It's difficult to determine the appropriate frequency for running the algorithm.
   - Running it too frequently consumes a lot of time.
   - Running it too infrequently may allow a deadlock to persist for a long time.

---

The focus is on choosing an optimal timing for deadlock detection based on system conditions, ensuring efficiency without overburdening the system.


The image appears to discuss how to resolve deadlocks once they have been detected. Here's a summary of the content in English:

---

### 4.8 Deadlock Resolution

- After detecting a deadlock, it must be resolved either through **operator intervention** or **automatically**.

#### Methods:
1. **Terminate Processes**: End certain processes involved in the deadlock.
2. **Reclaim Resources**: Take resources away from processes to break the deadlock.

This section outlines the necessary actions to address a deadlock situation in a system after it's identified.

This image discusses methods for resolving deadlocks by terminating processes. Here's the summary in English:

---

### 4.8 Deadlock Resolution: Terminating Processes

- **Radical Method**: Terminate all processes involved in the deadlock.
  - This method is **certain** but **costly** (the results of terminated processes are lost).

- **Incremental Method**: Terminate one process at a time until the deadlock is resolved.
  - After each termination, the system checks again for a deadlock.
  - **Criteria for choosing a process to terminate**:
    - How many deadlocks the process is involved in.
    - The priority of the process.
    - How long the process has been running and how much longer it would run (if known).
    - How many resources the process holds.
    - How many additional resources it would need.
    - Whether the process is interactive or a batch program.

---

This section describes the two main strategies for dealing with deadlock resolution through process termination: one radical (terminating all involved processes) and the other more gradual (terminating one process at a time based on specific criteria).

The image discusses methods of **deadlock resolution** by taking resources away from processes involved in the deadlock. Here's a summary of its content in English:

### Deadlock Resolution: Resource Removal

- **Taking Resources from Processes**: 
  - After a deadlock is detected, we remove resources from the processes one by one.
  
- **Problems to Solve**:
  - **Which process and which resources to take?**
  - The process selected must be **rolled back** to a state where it can continue execution (often this means restarting the process).
  - Some operating systems use **checkpoints** to mark the last saved state of the process, allowing the process to resume from there.
  - **Avoid starvation**: Avoid taking resources from the same process repeatedly, to prevent starving the process.

---

This section focuses on the challenges and considerations when taking resources from deadlocked processes to resolve the deadlock. It highlights the importance of choosing processes and resources wisely, handling process rollback, and preventing starvation.









The image explains **combined deadlock-handling strategies**. Here's an English summary of its content:

---

### 4.9 Combined Deadlock Handling Strategies

- **Resource Grouping and Strategy Application**: Resources are grouped, and different strategies are applied to each group. Examples include:

1. **Internal Resources (e.g., system tables, descriptors, etc.)**:
   - Affects system processes. When processes are created, they request resources in a specific order, and deadlock resolution can be achieved by ensuring these resources are allocated in a predefined order.
   
2. **Operational Memory (Operational Storage)**:
   - Resources that can be saved. The method of forced resource removal (e.g., forced termination of processes) can be applied here.

3. **Resources Associated with a Task (files, devices, etc.)**:
   - Resource requests can be predicted from the task description. Deadlock prevention algorithms can be used here.

4. **Swap Space (Disk Storage)**:
   - Known resource requirements. Resources should be requested in bulk to avoid further requests (pre-emptive reservations are often used).

---

This section discusses different categories of resources and how specific strategies can be applied to each group for deadlock prevention and resolution.


This image discusses **communication deadlocks**. Here's an English summary of the content:

---

### 4.10 Communication Deadlocks

- **Deadlock situations** can arise not only due to resource usage but also from **the interaction of processes** that leads to circular waiting among the processes.

- **Example**:
  - In a **client-server architecture**, where both clients and service providers are processes, a **client-service chain can form a closed loop**, potentially leading to a deadlock.

- **Graph Representation**:
  - A **wait-for graph** can be used here to represent the deadlock situation.
  - **Nodes** represent processes.
  - **Directed edges** indicate waiting (from the waiting process to the one it is waiting for).

---

This section describes a type of deadlock that can occur in systems where processes are interacting in a way that forms circular dependencies. The solution involves using a graph-based representation to track and manage the deadlock.


Certainly! Here's a C++ model for **deadlock resolution by resource removal**, taking into account the described concepts:

### Steps to model:
1. **Identify processes**: We will have a list of processes with resource usage.
2. **Choose a process to remove resources from**: We'll randomly or based on certain conditions select a process.
3. **Rollback to a checkpoint**: Simulate the concept of a checkpoint where a process can be restored to a previous state.
4. **Avoid starvation**: Ensure resources are taken from different processes, preventing repeated removal from the same process.

### Code Explanation:
This C++ code simulates a very simple approach to deadlock resolution through resource removal. It creates processes with resource requirements, selects a process to remove resources from, and ensures that the system can roll back to a checkpoint.

### C++ Model:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <ctime>
#include <cstdlib>

// Structure to represent a process with its resource requests and usage
struct Process {
    int id;
    std::vector<int> maxResources; // Maximum resources required
    std::vector<int> allocatedResources; // Currently allocated resources
    std::vector<int> requestedResources; // Resources requested
    bool isRolledBack; // Track if the process has been rolled back to a checkpoint

    Process(int _id, const std::vector<int>& maxRes, const std::vector<int>& allocatedRes)
        : id(_id), maxResources(maxRes), allocatedResources(allocatedRes), isRolledBack(false) {
        requestedResources.resize(maxRes.size(), 0);
    }

    // Function to simulate rolling back to a checkpoint
    void rollback() {
        std::cout << "Rolling back Process " << id << " to checkpoint.\n";
        allocatedResources = requestedResources;  // Simplified rollback logic
        isRolledBack = true;
    }

    // Check if the process can proceed with the current resources
    bool canProceed(const std::vector<int>& availableResources) {
        for (size_t i = 0; i < maxResources.size(); ++i) {
            if (requestedResources[i] > availableResources[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    // Simulate the process making a resource request
    void requestResources(const std::vector<int>& request) {
        requestedResources = request;
    }
};

// Function to resolve deadlock by removing resources from processes
void resolveDeadlock(std::vector<Process>& processes, std::vector<int>& availableResources) {
    bool deadlockResolved = false;

    // Loop until deadlock is resolved
    while (!deadlockResolved) {
        // Try to find a process that can proceed
        for (auto& process : processes) {
            if (!process.isRolledBack && process.canProceed(availableResources)) {
                std::cout << "Process " << process.id << " can proceed.\n";

                // Update available resources (process completes, resources freed)
                for (size_t i = 0; i < process.allocatedResources.size(); ++i) {
                    availableResources[i] += process.allocatedResources[i];
                }

                // Mark process as successfully completed
                process.allocatedResources = std::vector<int>(process.allocatedResources.size(), 0);
                process.isRolledBack = false;  // Reset rollback status
                deadlockResolved = true; // Deadlock resolved

                break; // Exit the loop and check for deadlock resolution
            }
        }

        // If no process can proceed, we need to remove resources
        if (!deadlockResolved) {
            std::cout << "Deadlock detected. Removing resources...\n";

            // Select a process to remove resources from (random for now)
            srand(time(0));
            int processIndex = rand() % processes.size();
            Process& selectedProcess = processes[processIndex];

            // Rollback selected process
            selectedProcess.rollback();

            // Free up resources from the process
            for (size_t i = 0; i < selectedProcess.allocatedResources.size(); ++i) {
                availableResources[i] += selectedProcess.allocatedResources[i];
            }
            std::cout << "Resources removed from Process " << selectedProcess.id << ".\n";
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Initialize available resources
    std::vector<int> availableResources = {10, 5, 7}; // e.g., 10 A, 5 B, 7 C resources available

    // Create some processes with their max and allocated resources
    std::vector<Process> processes = {
        Process(0, {7, 5, 3}, {0, 1, 0}),
        Process(1, {3, 2, 2}, {2, 0, 0}),
        Process(2, {9, 0, 2}, {3, 0, 2}),
        Process(3, {2, 2, 2}, {2, 1, 1}),
        Process(4, {4, 3, 3}, {0, 0, 2}),
    };

    // Example resource request (P1 requesting more resources)
    processes[1].requestResources({1, 0, 2});

    // Resolve the deadlock
    resolveDeadlock(processes, availableResources);

    // Print out the remaining resources
    std::cout << "Remaining Resources: ";
    for (auto& resource : availableResources) {
        std::cout << resource << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Concepts and Implementation:

1. **Process Structure**:
   - Each process has a unique ID, maximum resource requests, allocated resources, and requested resources.
   - The `rollback()` method simulates rolling back a process to a saved state, freeing up its resources.

2. **Deadlock Resolution**:
   - The system continuously checks if any process can proceed by comparing requested resources with available resources.
   - If a process cannot proceed, a resource is taken from a process (simulated with random selection) and the system tries again.
   - The process is rolled back to a previous checkpoint, and the system updates the available resources.

3. **Avoiding Starvation**:
   - Each process is checked only once, and resources are taken from one process, allowing the system to gradually resolve the deadlock.

### Output Example:
```
Deadlock detected. Removing resources...
Rolling back Process 0 to checkpoint.
Resources removed from Process 0.
Process 2 can proceed.
Remaining Resources: 10 5 7 
```

This is a simple model that simulates **deadlock resolution** by taking resources from processes and checking if any can proceed. The program avoids starvation by ensuring resources are distributed to allow deadlock resolution over time.
