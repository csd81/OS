**The Purpose of Protection**
- The operating system consists of hardware and software elements.  
- Each element has a unique identifier and can be accessed through predefined operations.  
- **The protection problem:** each element should only be accessed by authorized procedures, and it should be used correctly.

---

Would you like an explanation or examples of how this is applied in modern OS design?


Here's the English translation of the slide titled **"A fenyegetés forrásai"** (Sources of Threat):

---

**Sources of Threat**
- **Internal:**  
  – from processes within the system  
- **External:**  
  – from factors independent of the system

---

Let me know if you'd like real-world examples of internal and external threats to operating systems!

Here’s the full English translation of the slide titled **"Belső biztonság"** (Internal Security):

---

**Internal Security**
- **Internal security system**:  
  – protection against program errors,  
  – protection against unauthorized use of resources.  

- **Protection domain**: defines which resources a process can access in a given state and what operations it can perform on them.  
  – It should be defined as narrowly as possible; only truly necessary rights should be granted (**need-to-know principle**).  
  – A protection domain can be **static** or **dynamic** (changing with state).

---

Let me know if you'd like to go deeper into how protection domains are implemented in modern operating systems.

Here is the full English translation of the slide titled **"Védelmi tartományok"** (Protection Domains):

---

**Protection Domains**
- **Access rights:**  
  `<Object, {list of permissions}>`  
  where the list of permissions is a subset of operations that can be performed on the given object.

- **Protection domain (domain):** a set of access rights

Example domains:

- **Domain 1**  
  `<File1, {R}>`  
  `<File2, {R, W}>`  

- **Domain 2**  
  `<File3, {R}>`  
  `<File4, {R, W, X}>`  
  `<File5, {R, W}>`  
  `<Printer1, {W}>`  

- **Domain 3**  
  `<File6, {R, W, X}>`  
  `<Plotter2, {W}>`

**Example:**  
A process running in Domain 2 can perform **Read** and **Write** operations on **File5**.

---

Let me know if you'd like help understanding domain switching or access control matrices in this context!

Here’s the English translation of the slide titled **"Statikus védelmi tartomány"** (Static Protection Domain):

---

**Static Protection Domain**
- The **"rights" do not change** during the lifetime of the process.
- **Access matrix**:
  – Rows represent **domains**  
  – Columns represent **resources** (this is a sparse matrix)

| Domain | File1 | File2       | File3 | File4                  | File5       | File6                  | Printer1 | Plotter2 |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------|-------------------------|-------------|-------------------------|----------|----------|
| 1      | Read  | Read, Write |       |                         |             |                         | Write    |          |
| 2      |       |             | Read  | Read, Write, Execute    | Read, Write |                         | Write    |          |
| 3      |       |             |       |                         |             | Read, Write, Execute    | Write    | Write    |

---

This matrix shows which operations are allowed per domain on specific objects. In a **static model**, these permissions are fixed and do not change during execution.

Let me know if you’d like a dynamic version comparison or a deeper look into access control models.


Here’s the English translation of the slide titled **"Statikus védelmi tartomány ábrázolása"** (Representation of Static Protection Domain):

---

**Representation of Static Protection Domain**
- **Global table**  
- **Access control list**  
- **Capability list**

---

These are different ways to implement or represent access control in systems. Let me know if you want a comparison of how these approaches work!


Here is the full English translation of the slide titled **"Globális tábla"** (Global Table):

---

**Global Table**
- *(global table)*  
- Contains triplets of the form `<domain, resource, operation>`.  
- For every operation, the table must be searched completely.  
- The table is too large, so searching is slow.  
- Grouping is not possible (e.g., resources accessible to everyone must be listed in every domain).

---

This approach, while straightforward, is inefficient at scale. Let me know if you'd like to compare it with access control lists or capability lists next!


Here’s the English translation of the slide titled **"Hozzáférési lista (Access Control List)"**:

---

**Access Control List (ACL)**
- For every **resource**, a series of `<domain, operation>` pairs is listed, plus default operations (i.e., operations permitted for all domains).  
- They adapt to user needs. When a new resource is created, the operations that can be performed by protection domains can be defined accordingly.

*(The image highlights File1 and shows which domains have what kind of access to it.)*

---

Let me know if you want a practical example of how ACLs work in systems like Linux or Windows.

Here’s the translated and interpreted content of the slide titled **"Hozzáférési lista 2."** (Access Control List 2):

---

This diagram illustrates how **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** work in practice.

- **Top row:**  
  Three users or processes: **A**, **B**, and **C**  
  - **A** is the **owner** of the process.

- **Bottom section:**  
  A list of **files (F1, F2, F3)** and their corresponding **ACL entries**.

**Access rights per file:**
- **F1**:  
  - A: Read & Write (RW)  
  - B: Access allowed (A)

- **F2**:  
  - A: Read (R)  
  - B: Read & Write (RW)  
  - C: Read (R)

- **F3**:  
  - B: Read, Write, Execute (RWX)  
  - C: Read, Execute (RX)

---

This clearly shows how access is explicitly defined per user or process for each resource using ACLs. Would you like to compare this with capability-based systems next?

Here’s the English translation of the slide titled **"Jogosítványok listája (Capability List)"**:

---

**Capability List**
- For each **domain**, a series of `<resource, operation>` pairs is maintained.  
  A **capability** is a reference to a `<resource, operation>` pair.  
  These references are not directly accessible to the processes in the domain.

- It is **not tied to objects**, making it less intuitive (not object-centric).

- When using a resource, the process only **presents its capability**, and the OS only needs to **verify its validity**  
  (no need to search for permissions).

---

The capability list approach is efficient at runtime since access validation is direct. Let me know if you want to compare this to ACLs or talk about real-world capability-based systems!

Here’s the English translation of the slide titled **"Statikus védelmi tartományok megvalósítása"** (Implementation of Static Protection Domains):

---

**Implementation of Static Protection Domains**
- It is common to use both **access control lists (ACLs)** and **capability lists** together.  
- **Example:** In UNIX systems, when opening a file, the process must specify the operations it intends to perform.  
  The OS checks this using the **access control list**, and then the process is granted a **capability**. For subsequent operations, the process uses this capability.

---

This demonstrates a hybrid approach where ACLs help in the initial validation, and capabilities are used for efficient later operations. Let me know if you’d like to discuss this in more detail!


Here’s the full English translation of the slide titled **"Dinamikus védelmi tartomány"** (Dynamic Protection Domain):

---

**Dynamic Protection Domain**
- **Static protection domains** contain too many resources (everything must be included), while a **dynamic protection domain** contains only the necessary resources.
- **Access matrix** can also be used here.
- The protection domain is itself a resource, and it must be included in the matrix columns.

---

Dynamic protection domains allow more efficient resource allocation and access control, adjusting as needed. Would you like a deeper dive into how dynamic protection works in systems?


Here’s the English translation of the slide titled **"Hozzáférési mátrix dinamikus védelmi tartományokban"** (Access Matrix in Dynamic Protection Domains):

---

**Access Matrix in Dynamic Protection Domains**
- **Protection domain as a resource**
- **Operation**

The **Switch** in the diagram indicates that a process running in **Domain1** can switch to **Domain2**.

---

This slide illustrates the flexibility of dynamic protection domains, where a process can switch between different domains. If you'd like to explore this further or see a practical implementation, let me know!


Here’s the full English translation of the slide titled **"Dinamikus védelmi tartomány"** (Dynamic Protection Domain):

---

**Dynamic Protection Domain**
- **New entries in the access matrix:**

  - **Switch**:  
    – A process from a given domain can switch to the domain specified in the column.

  - **Copy**:  
    – A process in a given domain can copy its access rights to another domain.  
    The copy can be of two types:  
    – **Transfer**: The rights are deleted from the original domain.  
    – **Limited copy**: The rights cannot be further passed on from the new domain.

  - **Owner**:  
    – The owner of a resource can delete or give access rights to other domains (modifications along the columns).

  - **Control**:  
    – Allows modifications along rows. Only the columns for domains can contain these modifications.  
    – If one domain controls another, it can place or delete rights in that domain’s row.

---

This slide outlines the more advanced features of dynamic protection domains, such as rights transfer, ownership, and control over resources. Let me know if you would like to explore any of these mechanisms further!

  

Here’s the English translation of the slide titled **"Külső biztonság"** (External Security):

---

**External Security**
- **User identification**  
- **Logging**  
- **Cryptography**  

---

These are essential techniques for ensuring that systems are secure from external threats. Let me know if you'd like to explore any of these topics in more detail!

Here’s the English translation of the slide titled **"A felhasználók azonosítása"** (User Identification):

---

**User Identification**
- To prevent unauthorized access, users must be identified clearly and reliably:  
  – **User attributes** (fingerprint, retina, etc.)  
  – **Objects possessed by the user** (key, ID card, etc.)  
  – **Knowledge known by the user** (e.g., name, password)  

- Current systems mainly use **passwords** for identification:  
  – **Secure password** (good password selection, frequent password change)  
  – The system stores passwords in a **securely protected file** (encrypted).

---

This slide covers common methods used for user authentication and the importance of securing passwords. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any of these techniques!


Here’s the English translation of the slide titled **"A jelszó kezelése"** (Password Management):

---

**Password Management**
- The system does not store the password for security reasons (it is vulnerable to theft).  
- Instead of storing the password **p**, we store **f(p)**, where **f** is a **one-way function**.  
- **f(p)** is often public.  
- **Attack methods:**  
  – **Brute force attacks** with common passwords (e.g., dictionary attacks). It is likely that a few passwords will be found in the password file.  
  – **Note:** This is not targeted at a specific user; the goal is to acquire the password of anyone.  
- **Modification:** **Salting** (adding random data to the password before hashing).

---

This slide explains important concepts in password security, like hashing and salting to protect passwords. Let me know if you'd like further clarification on these techniques!


Here’s the English translation of the slide titled **"Sózott jelszó"** (Salted Password):

---

**Salted Password**
- The password file does not store **f(p)** (since **p** might be a common word!).  
- We store:  
  – A random **N** integer, which is the **salt**, and  
  – **f(pN)**.  

**Example** (password: apple):  
- **User2, 67832, f(alma67832)**  
  where:  
  – **User2** is the user identifier,  
  – **67832** is the salt,  
  – **f(alma67832)** is the stored hashed salted password.

- It becomes harder to perform **random brute force** attacks.

---

Salting improves password security by adding random data (the salt) to the password before hashing it, making dictionary attacks much more difficult. Let me know if you'd like a deeper explanation or practical example!

Here’s the full English translation of the slide titled **"Naplózás"** (Logging):

---

**Logging**
- The system logs:  
  – The **time** of access to each resource,  
  – The **operation** performed, and  
  – The **user** involved.

- **Logging does not prevent** actions, but it **facilitates the subsequent identification** of the perpetrator.

---

Logging plays a key role in security by tracking user actions for later review in case of unauthorized activity. Let me know if you’d like to discuss specific logging practices or tools!



Here’s the full English translation of the slide titled **"Rejtjelzés"** (Cryptography):

---

**Cryptography**
- Data transmitted over an unprotected information channel can be protected with **encryption**.
- **Public-key encryption** (trapdoor codes).  
  This also includes **message authentication** (to ensure the message has not been altered).
- **Partner authentication** (verifying the sender) and **electronic signatures**.

---

This slide introduces core concepts of cryptography, focusing on encryption, message integrity, and authentication. Let me know if you'd like more details on how these methods work in practice!



Here’s the English translation of the slide titled **"A rosszindulatú programok és jellemzőik"** (Malicious Programs and Their Characteristics):

---

**Malicious Programs and Their Characteristics**
- **Trojan horse**:  
  – They start by exploiting search paths, and the system finds a program with the same name before the intended program, or  
  – They often use mistyped commands (e.g., **ls** → **la**).

- **Trap door / back door**:  
  – In a program, the author includes sections that allow undocumented, unauthorized activities.  
  – There are also **compiler-based** or **library-based** back doors that are inserted into compiled code.

- **Worm**:  
  – A worm starts multiple instances of itself, overloading the system's central resources.

---

This slide discusses three common types of malicious programs: Trojans, back doors, and worms, along with their behaviors and impacts. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any of these topics!


Here’s the English translation of the slide titled **"A rosszindulatú programok és jellemzőik"** (Malicious Programs and Their Characteristics):

---

**Malicious Programs and Their Characteristics**
- **Virus**:  
  – It inserts its own instructions into other programs. When the program starts, these also run: propagation, damage.

- **Stack and Buffer Overflow Attack**:  
  – By exploiting unchecked limits in a program, control is transferred to the attacker's code (e.g., code injected via long inputs).

- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack**:  
  – Overloading the targeted machine, thus preventing it from performing its intended tasks.
