# Distributed systems

Sure! Here's the English translation and explanation of the slide titled **"10. Elosztott rendszerek"** (which means **"Distributed Systems"**):

---

### 10. Distributed Systems

- **What are distributed systems? Why are they needed?**  
  Explains the definition of distributed systems and the motivation for using them (e.g., scalability, reliability, resource sharing).

- **Types and characteristics of communication networks**  
  Discusses the different network types (e.g., LAN, WAN) and their properties (latency, bandwidth, reliability, etc.)—important because distributed systems rely on network communication.

- **Types of distributed operating systems**  
  Covers various models of distributed OSes, such as tightly-coupled and loosely-coupled systems, and how they manage resources and processes across multiple machines.

- **Design considerations for distributed systems**  
  Looks at key aspects of designing a distributed system, such as transparency (location, access, concurrency), fault tolerance, consistency, and security.

Let me know if you’d like a deeper dive into any of these points!

Here's the explanation and translation of slide **3 – "10.1 Bevezetés" (Introduction)**:

---

### 10.1 Introduction

- **"Distributed systems"**  
  Refers to the general term for systems where components located on different networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages.

- **Multiple computer systems connected via a communication network**  
  This highlights the core idea of a distributed system: it is composed of multiple independent computers (nodes) that are connected and communicate through a network to achieve a common goal.

---

So this slide briefly introduces the concept of distributed systems as **interconnected computer systems working together over a network**.

Let me know if you want a visual explanation or an example setup.



Here’s the explanation and English translation of slide **5 – “Motivációk” (Motivations)**:

---

### Motivations for Distributed Systems

- **Resource sharing:**  
  Special devices (e.g., printers, large storage, GPUs) can be shared across the system — there's no need to have one at every location.

- **Server – Client model:**  
  - **Dedicated:** Only provides services (e.g., a file server).  
  - **Non-dedicated:** Can also perform other tasks in addition to serving.

- **Reliability:**  
  If one node fails, it's not a big problem — other nodes can take over its tasks (fault tolerance).

- **Load balancing:**  
  Tasks can be distributed evenly among nodes. Less-loaded nodes can be given more tasks, which increases overall performance.

- **Speed improvement:**  
  Tasks can be executed in parallel across nodes (parallel processing), increasing the system's speed.

- **Communication:**  
  On top of existing low-level network communication, higher-level services can be built — like email, messenger apps, etc.

---

This slide summarizes the practical benefits of distributed systems, including better performance, fault tolerance, and efficient use of resources.

Let me know if you'd like examples or diagrams for any of these points!


Here's a TL;DR translation and summary of slide **6 – “10.2 Kommunikációs hálózatok” (Communication Networks)**:

---

### 10.2 Communication Networks

- **Topology:**  
  Structure/layout of the network (e.g., bus, ring, star, mesh).

- **Types of networks:**  
  Such as LAN, MAN, WAN, PAN, etc.

- **Traffic control (routing):**  
  How data is directed through the network.

- **Station connection methods:**  
  How devices (nodes) connect to the network.

- **Shared channel usage, contention:**  
  How multiple devices share communication channels and handle competition for access.

- **Structure of network systems:**  
  Overall architecture and organization of communication networks.

---

This section gives an overview of how devices are connected and communicate within distributed systems. Want visuals or real-world examples for any of these topics?

Here’s a TL;DR English translation and summary of slide **7 – “Topológia” (Topology):**

---

### Network Topology

- **Fully connected:**  
  - Expensive (connection count grows quadratically)  
  - Fast  
  - Reliable

- **Partially connected:**  
  - Cheaper  
  - Slower  
  - Less reliable

---

The slide compares two network topologies: one where every node is directly connected to all others (high cost but high performance), and another where only some nodes are connected (cheaper but with performance and reliability trade-offs).




Here’s a TL;DR English explanation of slide **8 – “Részlegesen összekapcsolt hálózatok: csillag” (Partially connected networks: star topology):**

---

### Star Topology (a type of partially connected network)

- **Cheap**  
- **Fast** (but can become overloaded at the central node)  
- **Reliable** (as long as the central node functions)  
- **If the central node fails, all connected nodes are isolated**  

---

So, a **star topology** is cost-effective and usually efficient, but it's highly dependent on the central node — making that a single point of failure.




Here’s a TL;DR English summary of slide **9 – “Részlegesen összekapcsolt hálózatok: kapcsolt” (Partially connected networks: switched):**

---

### Switched Networks

- **Switched (Kapcsolt)**  
  - Based on **star topology**  
  - The **switch** can dynamically create **point-to-point connections** between nodes depending on current traffic

---

So, this type of network uses a **switch** to manage connections more flexibly than a basic star. It's still a star in physical layout, but **logically it can behave like multiple direct links**, making it more efficient under variable traffic.






Here’s a TL;DR English summary of slide **10 – “Részlegesen összekapcsolt hálózatok: gyűrű” (Partially connected networks: ring):**

---

### Ring Topology (Gyűrű)

#### Variants:
- **Ring** (one direction)  
- **Bidirectional ring** (two directions)  
- **Dual ring** (redundant rings for reliability)

#### Characteristics:
- **Cheap**  
- **Slow**  
- **Unreliable**

---

In a **ring topology**, each node connects to exactly two others, forming a closed loop. It’s cost-effective but has performance and reliability issues — especially in single-ring setups where one break can disrupt communication.



Here’s a TL;DR English summary of slide **11 – “Részlegesen összekapcsolt hálózatok: faszerkezet” (Partially connected networks: tree structure):**

---

### Tree Topology

- **Cheap**  
- **Fast**  
- **Failure of certain nodes can fragment the network**  

---

A **tree topology** is hierarchical and structured like a tree, combining elements of star and bus topologies. It's efficient and cost-effective, but if a key node fails (like a root or central branch), it can break the connection to entire sections of the network.




Here’s a TL;DR English summary of slide **12 – “Részlegesen összekapcsolt hálózatok: busz” (Partially connected networks: bus):**

---

### Bus Topology  
(shared communication channel)

- **Cheap**  
- **Fast**  
- **Failure of individual nodes doesn't affect others**  
- **If the bus (main channel) fails, it’s catastrophic**

---

In a **bus topology**, all nodes share a single communication line. It’s simple and cost-effective, but **everything depends on the central bus line**—if it fails, the entire network goes down.









Here’s a TL;DR English summary of slide **13 – “Hálózatok típusai kiterjedésük alapján” (Types of networks based on their extent):**

---

### **Local Area Network (LAN)**

- **"Lokális" = Local**
- **LAN (Local Area Network)** connects computers and devices within a limited area (like a home, office, or building).
- Typically fast and private.
- The diagram shows:
  - **Devices** like micros, minis, printers, and file systems
  - **A shared communication line (bus topology)**
  - **A gateway** for connecting to other networks

---

LANs are the most common type of network in small-scale environments and serve as the foundation for most distributed systems within an organization.






Great question!

In the context of the diagram on **slide 13**, **“micro”** refers to **microcomputers** — these are personal computers (PCs), typically used by end users.

Here’s a quick breakdown of the terms shown:

- **Micro** = Microcomputer (e.g., desktops, laptops)
- **Mini** = Minicomputer (a mid-sized computer, more powerful than a micro, often used for specific tasks like database handling or multi-user applications)
- **File system** = A storage system/server managing files
- **Printer** = Shared network printer
- **Gateway** = A device that connects this LAN to another network (like the internet or another LAN)

So, in short, **“micro” = typical user computers** on a LAN.





Here’s a TL;DR English summary of slide **14 – “Hálózatok típusai kiterjedésük alapján” (Types of networks based on their extent):**

---

### **Wide Area Network (WAN)**  
**Hungarian: Nagy területű hálózat**

- A **WAN** connects computers over **large geographic distances** (cities, countries, continents).
- Often built using leased telecom lines or satellite links.
- Slower and more complex than LANs, but essential for connecting multiple LANs together.

---

### Diagram Breakdown:
- **H = Host (network computers)**  
- **CP = Communication Processor**  
- **OP = Other Processing Nodes**  
- The central cloud shows a **WAN backbone** — the infrastructure that transmits data between hosts using multiple hops and routing.

---

In simple terms:  
**LAN = local building or office**  
**WAN = global or regional communication infrastructure (like the internet)**

Let me know if you want a comparison between LAN and WAN!



Here's a **detailed explanation and translation** of slide **15 – "Forgalomirányítás" (Routing / Traffic Control):**

---

## **Traffic Control (Forgalomirányítás / Routing)**

### 🔁 **Routing**
- **Purpose:** Used when **there is no full direct connection** between all nodes.
- **Function:** Determines the path a message should take through the network using a **routing table**.

---

### 📋 **Routing Table (Táblázat)**
The table is used to determine routes based on:
- **Possible routes** (to a destination)
- **Additional information**, such as:
  - **Channel speed**
  - **Cost**
  - **Current load**
- **Needs to be updated regularly** to reflect changing network conditions.

---

### 🧭 **Fixed Route (fix útvonal)**
- The message always travels via a **predefined route** (e.g., shortest or cheapest path).
- Routing is **static** and does not adapt to network conditions.

---

### 🔌 **Virtual Circuit (virtuális áramkör)**
- A **temporary path is established** before data transfer.
- **Three phases:**
  1. **Setup** (path creation)
  2. **Transmission**
  3. **Teardown** (path release)

---

### 🔄 **Dynamic Routing (dinamikus)**
- Each message is routed **independently**.
- Routing decisions are made **per message** at each node.
- More **adaptive and fault-tolerant**, but computationally more complex.

---

### Summary:
- **Fixed:** Simple, fast, but not adaptable.
- **Virtual circuit:** Predefined like fixed, but temporary.
- **Dynamic:** Most flexible, adapts to load/failures, but slower per message.

Let me know if you'd like visual examples or simulations of these routing types!



Here is a detailed explanation and translation of slide **16 – “Állomások kapcsolódásának módjai”** (Ways of connecting stations):

---

## **Connection Methods Between Stations**

This slide compares the **three primary communication modes** in network systems:

---

### 🔌 **Circuit-Switched (Áramkörkapcsolt)**
- **Exclusive use** of a communication line is established between sender and receiver for the entire session.
- Once set up, the channel is **reserved**, even if no data is being sent at a given moment.
- **Example:** Like a traditional **telephone call** — the line is dedicated to the call until it ends.
- ✅ Fast transmission  
- ❌ Inefficient for intermittent communication (wastes bandwidth)

---

### ✉️ **Message-Switched (Üzenetkapcsolt)**
- For each message, a **temporary physical path** is assigned.
- **Entire messages** (which can be large) are sent to intermediate nodes.
  - These nodes must **store the full message**, and then **forward** it.
- **Example:** Like **postal mail forwarding** — the entire letter is received at each post office and then sent on.
- ✅ More efficient than circuit-switching for long, bursty messages  
- ❌ Needs large **buffer** capacity at nodes  
- ❌ Higher **delay** due to store-and-forward

---

### 📦 **Packet-Switched (Csomagkapcsolt)**
- The message is split into **small packets** (done by the sender).
- Packets are sent **independently** and may take different paths.
- The **receiver reassembles** the message from the packets.
- ✅ No need for large buffers (each packet is small)  
- ✅ Efficient use of network resources  
- ❌ Added **overhead** (headers for each packet)  
- ❌ Can be **slower** due to routing and reordering

---

### Summary Table:

| Method            | Dedicated Line | Buffer Needs | Speed        | Example            |
|-------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Circuit-switched  | Yes            | Low           | Fast         | Telephone           |
| Message-switched  | No             | High          | Medium-slow  | Postal service      |
| Packet-switched   | No             | Low           | Slower (but efficient) | Internet data (TCP/IP) |

Let me know if you'd like a diagram or simulation of how these work!



Here's a detailed explanation and translation of slide **17 – “Osztott csatornahasználat, versengés” (Shared channel usage and contention):**

---

## **Shared Channel Usage & Contention**

### 🧵 Concept:
- Multiple stations (computers/devices) **share the same communication medium**.
  - Common in **bus** and **ring** topologies.
- **Only one station can use the channel at a time** to avoid collision.
- **If two or more stations try to use it simultaneously → collision/error**.

---

### ⚙️ Handling Contention (Kezelés):

#### 1. **CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)**  
   - Used in **Ethernet** networks.  
   - Stations "listen" to the medium before sending.  
   - If the channel is busy, they wait.  
   - If a collision is detected, transmission stops and is retried after a random delay.

#### 2. **Token Passing**  
   - A **token** (special data packet) circulates through the network.  
   - Only the station with the token can transmit.  
   - Prevents collisions and ensures fair access.

#### 3. **Message Slots**  
   - Time is divided into **slots**, and stations are assigned or compete for slots.  
   - More common in time-controlled or scheduled systems.

---

### Summary:
In shared media environments, **access control** is essential to prevent data collisions and ensure smooth communication. These methods are different strategies to coordinate access among multiple competing stations.

Let me know if you want animations or diagrams for any of these methods!


Here's a **detailed explanation and translation** of slide **18 – “Hálózati rendszerek szerkezete” (Structure of Network Systems)**:

---

## 📡 Structure of Network Systems

Implementing network communication requires a **complex, layered system**.  
The **ISO-OSI model** (Open Systems Interconnection model) is used to **organize** this complexity into **7 layers**, each with its own role and protocols.

---

### 🔹 **1. Physical Layer** (Fizikai) – *e.g., Cat5e*
- Handles **mechanical and electrical transmission** of data (bits).
- Defines **cables, signals, connectors**.
- Focus: raw bit-level communication.

---

### 🔹 **2. Data Link Layer** (Adatkapcsolati) – *e.g., CSMA/CD*
- Responsible for **node-to-node delivery** (between adjacent devices).
- Packages bits into **frames**, handles **error detection and correction** at the physical level.
- Example: Ethernet (CSMA/CD).

---

### 🔹 **3. Network Layer** (Hálózati) – *e.g., IP*
- Manages **routing** between devices across multiple networks.
- Assigns **unique addresses** (like IP addresses), and determines the **path** data takes.
- Focus: packet forwarding and logical addressing.

---

### 🔹 **4. Transport Layer** (Szállítási) – *e.g., TCP*
- Ensures **reliable data transfer** between hosts.
- Handles **segmentation/reassembly** of messages, **flow control**, and **error handling**.
- Controls **data speed** (prevents flooding the receiver).

---

### 🔹 **5. Session Layer** (Viszony)
- Establishes, maintains, and terminates **communication sessions**.
- Manages **dialogues/synchronization** between applications (e.g., remote login sessions).

---

### 🔹 **6. Presentation Layer** (Megjelenítési) – *e.g., partly HTTP*
- Translates and **formats data** (syntax, encoding conversions).
- Handles things like **character sets** (ASCII ↔ EBCDIC), **compression**, **encryption/decryption**.

---

### 🔹 **7. Application Layer** (Alkalmazási) – *e.g., FTP, Email, HTTP, Telnet*
- Closest to the **user**.
- Provides **network services** like file transfer, email, web browsing, authentication, etc.

---

### 📡 Key Point:
> Every layer at the source communicates with its **peer layer** at the destination, using **protocols** that define the rules of communication.

---

Would you like a diagram of the OSI model or a real-world example mapped to these layers?


Here’s a detailed explanation and translation of slide **19 – “10.3 Elosztott operációs rendszerek típusai” (Types of Distributed Operating Systems):**

---

## **Types of Distributed Operating Systems**

---

### 🌐 **1. Network Computing Model (Hálózati számítási modell)**

- The **user knows** which resource is located on which machine.
- The user **must specify both the service provider and the resource**.
- Essentially, the user is interacting with a network of visible computers.

#### Examples:
- **Remote terminal (remote login)** – user logs into a specific remote machine.
- **File transfer (FTP, SCP)** – files are explicitly moved between machines.

✅ Transparent access: ❌ No  
Transparency is **low** — users are aware of and manage remote resources manually.

---

### 🧠 **2. Distributed Computing Model (Elosztott számítási modell)**

- The **operating system runs on multiple machines simultaneously**.
- The user **doesn’t know** if a resource is local or remote — it appears seamless.
- Requires **middleware** to handle communication between client and server components.

#### Characteristics:
- High **transparency** (location, access, replication, etc.).
- Middleware handles **remote resource access**, making everything feel local.

✅ Transparent access: ✅ Yes  
Everything looks like it’s on the same system — much more user-friendly.

---

### Summary:

| Feature                         | Network Model                     | Distributed Model                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| User awareness of location      | Yes                               | No                                |
| Transparency                    | Low                               | High                              |
| Example                         | Remote login, FTP                 | Distributed file systems, cloud OS |
| Needs middleware                | No                                | Yes                               |

Here is a detailed explanation and English translation of **slide 20 – “Információcsere elosztott számítási modellben”** (Information exchange in the distributed computing model):

---

## 💡 Information Exchange in Distributed Computing

In a **distributed system**, multiple computers collaborate to perform tasks, and information needs to move efficiently between them. Here are the main **mechanisms** for that:

---

### 📁 **1. Data Migration (Adatvándorlás)**
- **What happens?**  
  A **remote file or data** (or part of it) is **copied to the local machine**.
- After the work is done, the result is **written back to the original location**.
- 📌 Used when it's more efficient to move the data than to process it remotely.

---

### 🧠 **2. Computation Migration (Feldolgozás vándorlás)**
- **What happens?**  
  Instead of moving **a large dataset**, it's more efficient to send the **program or computation** to the location of the data, process it there, and return only the result.
- 📌 Used when **data size is large**, and moving it would be slow or expensive.

---

### ✉️ **3. Message Passing (Üzenetküldés)**
- One component **sends an operation (command)** to another and moves on.
- Very common in distributed systems where nodes need to exchange short commands or signals.

---

### 📞 **4. Remote Procedure Call (Távoli eljáráshívás)**
- A function or procedure is **called on a remote computer**.
- The caller **waits for the result** to be returned.
- Works like a local function call, but the execution happens **remotely**.

---

### 🔄 **5. Process Migration (Folyamatvándorlás)**
- A **process or parts of it** (e.g. threads) **run on a different machine** than where it started.
- **Why?**  
  1. **Load balancing**: to distribute processing evenly across nodes  
  2. **Parallelism**: for faster execution  
  3. **Optimal environment**: a machine may offer better hardware/software  
  4. **Faster data access**: process moves closer to where the data is

- ⚠️ **The user is unaware of this movement** — it’s handled by the system to optimize performance.

---

### 🧩 Summary Table:

| Mechanism             | Description                                      | Use Case                        |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Data migration         | Move data to local machine                       | Small program, large data        |
| Computation migration  | Move computation to where data is                | Large data, small program        |
| Message passing        | Send message and move on                         | Lightweight communication        |
| Remote procedure call  | Remote function call + wait                      | Client-server interactions       |
| Process migration      | Move process to another machine                  | Load balancing, optimization     |

Here is a detailed explanation and English translation of **slide 21 – “10.4 Az elosztott rendszerek tervezésének szempontjai (1)”**  
(= Design considerations for distributed systems, part 1):

---

## 🔧 10.4 Design Considerations for Distributed Systems (Part 1)

---

### 🔍 **1. Transparent Distributed System (Átlátszó elosztott rendszer)**

**Goal:**  
Make the distributed system **appear as a single, unified system** to the user. The user should **not notice whether they are using local or remote resources**.

#### Key characteristics:
- **Location transparency:**  
  The user cannot tell whether the resource is local or remote.
  
- **Mobility transparency:**  
  When the user logs into a different machine, their familiar environment (e.g., files, settings) follows them.
  
✅ Makes the system **easy and seamless to use**.  
❌ Requires significant underlying complexity (e.g., synchronization, replication, session handling).

---

### 🛡️ **2. Fault Tolerance (Hibatűrés)**

**Goal:**  
The system must be **resilient to failures** — it should continue working even if parts of it break down.

#### Key aspects:
- If one **node (computer) fails**, others take over its tasks.
  - ⚠️ **Performance may degrade**, but **the system continues running**.
- When the failed node is repaired, it should **automatically reintegrate** into the system without manual reconfiguration.

✅ Ensures **high availability and reliability**  
🔁 Often implemented using redundancy, monitoring, and automatic recovery mechanisms.

---

### Example Scenario:

A user logs in from a different city → their desktop, apps, and files appear just as at home (transparency).  
Meanwhile, if a server goes down, other servers pick up its tasks without the user noticing (fault tolerance).

---

Let me know if you'd like visual examples, fault-tolerant architecture diagrams, or real-world use cases!

Here’s a detailed explanation and English translation of **slide 22 – “Az elosztott rendszerek tervezésének szempontjai (2)”**  
(= Design Considerations for Distributed Systems – Part 2):

---

## 🔧 Design Considerations for Distributed Systems (2)

### 📈 **Scalability (Skálázhatóság)**

Scalability means the system should continue to function efficiently as **load or size increases**.

---

### ✅ **Key Requirements:**

- The **system architecture and applications should not require redesign** when the system grows.
  > Adding new users, machines, or data should not require rewriting software or changing the architecture.

- The system must **adapt to increasing load** without breaking down or crashing.

- **Adding more nodes (computers) should not degrade performance** or cause **overload**.
  - Must be able to **scale horizontally** (add more machines).

---

### 🔁 **Related to Fault Tolerance:**

- **Redundancy** is essential:
  - If one component fails, **another can take its place**.
  - Redundant components can also help handle **higher loads**.

---

### 🚫 Avoid Centralized Services:

- Centralized services create **single points of failure**.
  - If one central server goes down, the system **collapses**.
  - Central services may become **overloaded** as the system grows.

> ❗ Fully centralized designs are **not scalable**.

---

### 🧱 **Clusters (Fürtözés):**

- Full decentralization is **difficult to achieve** in practice.
- Therefore, systems are often built using **clusters**:
  - Nodes are **grouped into clusters** (loosely connected groups).
  - Each cluster handles part of the work.
  - Helps balance load and improve fault tolerance.

---

### 📌 Summary:

| Goal                         | Design Principle                                  |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Handle more users/nodes      | Avoid architectural rework                        |
| Stay responsive under load   | Dynamically allocate resources                    |
| Prevent overload             | Add nodes without performance drop               |
| Avoid single points of failure | Decentralize services                            |
| Be fault-tolerant & adaptive | Add redundancy and clustering                     |

Here’s a **detailed explanation and translation** of **slide 23 – “Az elosztott rendszerek tervezésének szempontjai (3)”**  
(= Design Considerations for Distributed Systems – Part 3):

---

## ⚙️ Server Implementation (Szerver implementáció)

In a distributed system, servers are critical components. Their **design and implementation must be optimized** to handle massive load and parallelism.

---

### 🧠 **1. High Concurrency Handling**

> "Szervereknek több ezer aktív kérés egyidejű kiszolgálását kell bírni."

- Servers must be able to **serve thousands of simultaneous active requests**.
- This requires:
  - **Specialized hardware (HW)**: high-performance CPUs, large memory, fast I/O
  - **Specialized software (SW)**: optimized operating systems and network stacks
  - Efficient **architectures** that support parallelism and scalability.

---

### 🔄 **2. Per-Client Parallel Activity**

> "Ügyfelenként (kliens) egy-egy párhuzamos tevékenység..."

- Each client (user or device) initiates a **parallel thread or task** on the server.
- These threads often access **shared resources**, so access must be **synchronized** properly (e.g., databases, file systems, in-memory data).

---

### 🚀 **3. Thread-Based Concurrency for Shared Tasks**

> "Az azonos párhuzamos tevékenységhez szálakat rendelnek..."

- For repeated, similar types of concurrent operations (like handling HTTP requests), **dedicated threads** are assigned.
- Using **threads** (as opposed to full processes) allows:
  - **Faster context switching**
  - **Lower overhead**
  - **Better performance and responsiveness**

---

Would you like a diagram or real-world server architecture example (like how Nginx or Apache handles concurrency)?


Below is an example of a C++ simulation that mimics a fairly complex distributed system. In this simulation:

- **Nodes:** Each node is represented as an object that runs in its own thread. Every node has its own message queue (protected by mutexes and condition variables) and is capable of sending and receiving messages.
- **Network:** There’s a central simulated network object that provides message routing between nodes. It simulates network delays and provides both direct point-to-point messaging and broadcasting.
- **Messages:** The simulation uses different message types (e.g., compute requests and replies) that nodes exchange. When a node receives a compute request, it “processes” it (simulated with a delay) and replies with a result message.
- **Concurrency:** Thread-based concurrency (using C++11 threads) is used so that nodes can concurrently process incoming messages and generate new ones.
- **Randomization:** Random delays and random destination selection are used to mimic asynchronous behavior and dynamic routing.

You can compile this code (for example with a C++11/C++14 compiler) and run the simulation for about 10 seconds. At the end, the threads are signaled to stop and then joined.

### Explanation

1. **Message Structure:**  
   The `Message` struct holds information like sender/receiver IDs, a type (for different operations), a unique message ID, and a content string.

2. **Network Class:**  
   - Maintains a registry of nodes.  
   - The `sendMessage` method introduces an artificial delay (to simulate network latency) and delivers the message to the appropriate node.  
   - The `broadcastMessage` method sends a given message to all nodes (except the sender).

3. **Node Class:**  
   - Each node has its own message queue along with a mutex and condition variable for safe concurrent access.  
   - In the `run` method, the node registers itself with the network and then enters a loop where it periodically processes incoming messages and generates new ones (simulate work).  
   - When receiving a compute request message, the node processes it (simulated by a delay) and sends back a compute result message.
   - The `simulateWork` method randomly triggers the sending of messages to other nodes to simulate the ongoing operations of a distributed system.

4. **Main Function:**  
   - Five nodes are created and started in separate threads.  
   - The system runs for a fixed period (10 seconds) before being shut down gracefully by signaling each node to stop and then joining their threads.

This simulation, while simplified, demonstrates many key elements of a distributed system—including concurrency, asynchronous message passing, dynamic routing (via random selection), and fault-tolerant-like behavior by decoupling the node actions.

Feel free to adjust parameters (such as the number of nodes, delays, or message types) to explore different distributed system behaviors.
